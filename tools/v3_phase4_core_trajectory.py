"""Post-Phase-4 evidence: core-ownership trajectories from committed replays.

Produces every number cited in the dated addendum to
``docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE4_DEFENSE_PAYOFF_CHARACTERIZATION.md``, so those claims are
reproducible from the repository rather than resting on a transcript.

This is **measurement only**. It changes no scoring, no Ruleset, and no
default, and it is deliberately *not* the Phase 5A qualification harness
(see ``docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE5_DEFENSIVE_EVENT_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md``, which has not
been implemented): it samples 6 of the 11 committed group rosters at the
default condition, whereas Phase 5A's own gates require the full 594-cell
corpus plus other density conditions.

Two analyses, both reconstructed purely from committed artifacts:

``trajectory``
    Per-tick count of core cells each entrant still owns, replayed from
    ``memory_diffs`` (``address``/``length``/``owner``) starting at tick 0,
    with each entrant's core anchor taken from its tick-0 ``pc`` (published
    before any agent acts, and documented as ``[start, start]`` in
    ``AgentState.region`` for Python entrants). Used to show that generic
    "damaged then recovered" and "reached the brink and survived" are both
    non-selective for defense.

``incursions``
    Per-tick count of *ownership transitions away from* each entrant inside
    its own core window -- i.e. how many of its core cells an opponent took
    that tick. Used to show that concentrated (>= 4 cells in one tick)
    incursions separate committed assault bursts from incidental sweep
    contact, which no sweeper can produce at these strides.
