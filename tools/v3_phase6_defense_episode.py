"""v3 Phase 6 -- active-defensive-intervention detector (measurement only).

Phase 5A qualified a *same-tick* defensive-success event and found it
measures "was assaulted and survived" rather than "defended": expansion
agents absorb bursts constantly and often survive them, and the event goes
inert whenever ``instr_per_tick`` is too small for an attacker to concentrate
its assault into one tick (``docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE5A_DEFENSIVE_EVENT_QUALIFICATION.md``
Sec 3, Sec 5 C3). Its own post-hoc Sec 6 found that requiring the victim to
*actively reclaim* a cell restores near-perfect selectivity, but that result
was same-tick only, unvalidated at low action budgets, and explicitly not
load-bearing for its verdict.

This module reconstructs, purely from committed replay artifacts, a
cross-tick **attack episode**: a maximal, uninterrupted sequence of hostile
acquisitions by one attacker against one victim's core. An episode's
*continuity* (when it opens, extends, and closes) is defined entirely by
ownership state transitions -- capture, full reclaim, or full third-party
takeover -- never by a tick-count window, per the governing Phase 6 task's
explicit instruction not to guess one.

A window *is* used, but only to decide whether an episode's progress counts
as "meaningful hostile progress" rather than incidental contact -- seeded by
a pilot-stage finding (this module's own docstring on ``max_assault_ticks``
and Sec 4/6 of the governing report) that an *unbounded* episode is too
permissive: a blind expansion sweeper (``core_defender``'s own outward
sweep is `claimer`-shaped, `hunter`-shaped, and so on) can lap the whole
arena many times over a 400-tick match and slowly accumulate cells from an
undefended victim's core one incidental touch at a time, without ever
mounting a concentrated assault. Bounding how quickly an episode must reach
its threshold is what tells the two apart, and the bound is derived from
``ASSAULT_WINDOW`` -- the search agents' own published burst-width constant
-- and the match's action budget, never from an outcome. No match is
executed and no scoring, Ruleset, weight, agent, or default is touched.

Mechanics this reconstruction depends on (Phase 6A audit; verified against
``engine/src/battle_engine/python_runtime.py`` and ``vm.py``, not assumed):

* Every core-ownership mutation routes through ``VM._wr8``, which always
  records a diff and updates ``vm.writer`` -- an entrant's own write to its
  own core always *claims* the cell; there is no unclaim operation, so an
  entrant cannot lower its own core-owned count by any action available to
  it (Phase 5 Sec 3 point 3, reconfirmed here as the structural basis for
  Phase 6E's self-farming analysis).
* ``vm.tick_diffs`` -- and therefore ``TickSnapshot.memory_diffs`` -- is in
  **true chronological write order** within a tick (``_attribute_core_capture``'s
  own docstring: "entrants act in fixed scheduled order, so diffs are
  appended in the order writes actually happened").
* Scheduling is **sequential-quota per entrant**, not round-robin
  (``scheduler.run_sequential_quota``): within one tick, a seat completes its
  *entire* action quota before the next seat acts at all. This is the
  mechanical reason Phase 5A's same-tick reclaim was seat-order-sensitive --
  only a seat acting *later* in that tick's fixed block order can react to an
  earlier seat's attack within the same tick. A cross-tick episode lets a
  victim seated *earlier* still reclaim, on its own next tick, provided the
  assault has not already zeroed its core that same tick.
* The core-capture check (``apply_core_capture``) runs exactly once per tick,
  after every seat's actions for that tick, comparing against a snapshot
  taken *before* any of that tick's actions ran. Capture attribution
  (``_attribute_core_capture``) and its resulting ``kill``/``death``
  ``TickSnapshot.events`` entries are authoritative and are reused directly
  here rather than re-derived, which also gives Phase 6N an independent
  cross-check: this module's own episode-closure attacker attribution can be
  compared against the engine's own recorded killer for the same tick.
* Core anchors are recovered from each entrant's tick-0 ``pc`` (Phase 4/5A's
  own method, reused unmodified): ``core_start = entrant.start % arena_size``
  and no action has executed by the time tick 0 is published, so tick-0
  ``pc`` equals ``core_start`` for every Python entrant in this corpus.
