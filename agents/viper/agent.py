"""Viper -- an asymmetric phase-switching infiltrator, Agent API v2.

Two declared processes split the fixed per-tick Q=8 budget:

    ``raider``   (reach 10, share 0.75) -- expansion, detection, and the
                 permanent kill-lock assault once a target is acquired.
    ``sentinel`` (reach 8,  share 0.25) -- stays home and reactively
                 defends Viper's own vulnerable core.

``raider`` runs two phases:

    Phase "expand" -- claims ground by writing every cell within its
        current reach (``fill_index`` cycling ``0..self_reach-1``), then
        ``MOVE``s onward by ``EXPANSION_STRIDE`` (nudged to stay coprime
        with ``arena_size``, exactly like the original design's Phase 0)
        once a stop is fully claimed. Every call also gets
        ``visible_enemy_anchor_addresses`` for free -- Agent API v2
        detection is automatic and current-only (docs/AGENT_API_V2.md
        Sec "Observation"), so there is no active v1-style READ scan to
        run: the instant any enemy process comes within ``raider``'s
        reach, this is Phase 1's "probe" already satisfied.
    Phase "assault" -- entered the moment expand ever sees a non-empty
        ``visible_enemy_anchor_addresses``, and never left again. Every
        process starts co-located with its own entrant's fixed core
        (docs/V4_ALPHA1_DESIGN.md Sec 4), so a first sighting is a strong
        proxy for the opponent's core location even after that process
        later moves away -- ``raider`` commits to an ``ASSAULT_WINDOW``-cell
        band centred on that first sighted address and cycles ``WRITE``
        across it forever, moving only enough to keep the current target
        cell in reach. "Until elimination" is realized as "forever, on the
        one location acquired": v4 alpha1's Agent API gives no elimination
        signal (docs/AGENT_API_V2.md's WRITE Information Boundary -- a
        WRITE reports only whether it legally applied, never whether it
        disrupted or killed anything), so there is no stopping condition to
        check even if Viper wanted one, and no way to re-verify or
        re-triangulate the target once its own process has wandered off --
        this is a real, undefended bet, exactly the honest trade-off
        docs/AGENT_AUTHORING.md's Raider/Sentinel already each document.

``sentinel`` never moves (it starts exactly on Viper's own core, per the
same co-location rule) and spends its whole budget on the Interrupt:
reactive core defense. Each call it either consumes the previous cell's
verdict or issues a fresh one:

    one action READs the next of the ``CORE_SIZE_HINT`` core cells in
    rotation; the very next ``sentinel`` call checks
    ``observation.previous_read_owner`` for that exact address and, only if
    it names some entrant other than Viper itself, spends that call
    repairing it with a ``WRITE`` before resuming the rotation. An
    unattacked core costs one READ per rotation step and nothing else; a
    contested cell is repaired the very next time ``sentinel`` is scheduled
    after the check that found it, not on a fixed timer.

Why Agent API v2 / Ruleset v4 alpha1 (``bytefray-rules-4-alpha1``)
originally, and what that cost relative to an Agent API v1 design: v4
alpha1's Python-runtime process loop reuses the exact same core-capture
kill rule Ruleset v2 defined (``battle_engine.process_runtime`` calls
``python_runtime.apply_core_capture`` every tick, unconditionally), so
"vulnerable core" and "kill-lock until elimination" are still real, live
mechanics here -- but the *Agent API* built around v4 alpha1 is a genuinely
different observation/action model, not a compatible superset of v1:
``READ``/``WRITE`` stay absolute-address but are bounded by a movable
process's ``self_reach`` instead of being valid anywhere in the arena, so
"probing" is achieved by moving into range rather than by reading distant
cells; ownership is reported directly as ``previous_read_owner`` instead of
inferred from a raw byte and a remembered signature; and enemy detection is
an automatic engine service (``visible_enemy_anchor_addresses``) rather than
something Viper has to go looking for. v1 and v2 entrants cannot appear in
the same match (docs/AGENT_AUTHORING.md), so this version cannot be
development-tested against the Agent API v1 ``claimer`` starter -- use a v2
opponent instead, e.g.::

    bytefray agents validate viper
    bytefray agents test viper --opponent v4_claimer --ruleset bytefray-rules-4

``bytefray-rules-4-alpha1`` was retired from executable registration by V6
Phase 2B.10 Scope B
(docs/research/v6/V6_PHASE2B10_SCOPE_B_V4_ALPHA_RETIREMENT.md): an explicit
``--ruleset bytefray-rules-4-alpha1`` selection, once this agent's own
documented historical showcase choice, is no longer available at all, and
the example above now names the permanent ``bytefray-rules-4`` instead.
This was always a showcase choice, not a functional requirement: Viper's
own target-acquisition logic makes no placement assumption of its own --
it acquires targets from ``visible_enemy_anchor_addresses``, exactly like
the alpha2-adapted ``hydra_alpha2``/``nemesis_alpha2`` -- so nothing here
actually depends on alpha1's fixed evenly-spaced/priority-order semantics
that the design commentary above describes; Viper runs unchanged under
stable ``bytefray-rules-4``, which is gameplay-identical to what
``bytefray-rules-4-alpha2`` used to run.

Not a claim of optimal strategy: permanently committing to the first
sighted address means Viper cannot recover from ever mis-timing that first
sighting (an enemy glimpsed mid-sweep, far from its actual core, locks in a
band that may never be revisited), and ``sentinel``'s reactive checks cost
real ``raider`` budget indirectly, since total entrant throughput is capped
at Q=8 regardless of process count -- the same honest trade-offs an Agent
API v1 version of this design would document, now re-derived for a
different contract.
