# evaluation_history

**Modules:** `engine/src/battle_engine/agent_evaluation.py` (v2 writer,
additive), `engine/src/battle_engine/evaluation_history/` (new package: v1/v2
adapters, discovery, comparison, health, CLI), with narrow, discovery-ID-only
fixes to `app/services/agent_catalog.py`, `app/views/development.py`,
`app/views/evaluation.py`, `app/agent_designer.py`.
**Purpose:** harden `bytefray.evaluation` capture (v2) and add read-only,
Qt-free history/comparison across evaluation runs: `bytefray agents
evaluations list|show|compare`.

Status: design spec, written before implementation, per `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
spec → issue → prompt → PR flow. Built incrementally alongside
implementation; kept authoritative and synchronized as each slice lands.

**v0.9 note:** this spec predates entrant orientation and fixed-arena-
alignment disclosure (v0.9 Phase 6). `AdaptedCell.orientation` and
`EvaluationSummary.orientation_mode`/`arena_alignment_mode`
(`ConfidenceValue`-wrapped, same pattern as `rules_compatibility_id` below)
are additive fields this document's `condition_key`/`AdaptedCell` sketches
do not yet show; `condition_key` (§ below) now also includes `orientation`
and `arena_alignment_mode` as tuple elements, alongside `rules_compatibility_id`.
None of this changes the alignment/recovery *principles* this spec
establishes — orientation and arena alignment follow the exact same
sibling-key, recovered-not-unknown treatment already documented here for
`rules_compatibility_id` — only the concrete field list has grown. See
`CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased entry and `docs/AGENT_LAB.md` for the current,
authoritative field list.

**v1.6 Phase 4 note:** `EvaluationSummary` (§11) gained one additional
field, `analysis` — a derived, never-persisted `EvaluationAnalysis` (Wilson
win-rate intervals, exact paired candidate-vs-baseline evidence) computed
by the v1/v2 adapters from the same `real_cells` they already reconstruct
for `aggregates_recomputed`/`comparison_recomputed`. It changes no
identity, health, or comparison semantics this spec establishes; see
`docs/archive/v1/V1_6_PHASE4_EVALUATION_ANALYSIS.md` for its full design.

**v1.6 Phase 5 note:** unlike Phase 4's `analysis`, Phase 5's behavior
profile is deliberately **not** an `EvaluationSummary` field, and is never
computed inside `adapt_v1`/`adapt_v2`/`discover` — each cell's own
`result.json` read is real, measured I/O (unlike Phase 4's free, in-memory
`analysis`), so wiring it into adaptation would have made `evaluations
list` pay a per-cell cost merely to enumerate artifacts. Instead, a new,
separate module (`evaluation_history/behavior_adapter.py`) builds
containment-checked `CellRef`s from an already-adapted summary's `cells`,
called only from `evaluations show`'s own command handler (skippable with
`--no-behavior`). `evaluations list` and every other read path in this
package are unaffected; see `docs/archive/v1/V1_6_PHASE5_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS.md` for
the full design and the measurements behind this choice.

## 1. Established v0.6.1 facts (verified in source, not assumed)

- `agent_evaluation.py` already implements `run_dir` on `agent_test.test_agent`
  (not a pending TODO — confirmed at `agent_test.py` and its use at
  `agent_evaluation._execute_cell`).
- `evaluation_id = stable_id("evaluation", {candidate identity, baseline
  identity or None, opponent identities (ordered), seeds (ordered), ticks,
  agent_api_version})`. It does **not** include `Config`'s other fields
  (`arena_size`, `instr_per_tick`, `win_mode`, `weights`) because
  `agent_test.py` never lets a caller vary them — they are always `Config()`
  defaults today. v2 must still record them explicitly (see §3) rather than
  relying on that being true forever.
- `canonical_match_id` (`match_service.py`) hashes the **full** effective
  `Config` (`seed`, `arena_size`, `instr_per_tick`, `win_mode`,
  `asdict(weights)`) plus per-entrant identity (`derived_seed`,
  `source_sha256`, `api_version`, `agent_version`) and entrant order. This is
  the existing canonical precedent for "effective execution conditions" — v2
  reuses its shape rather than inventing a second one.
- `tournament.json` (`battle2.tournament` v1) has **no timestamp fields at
  all** — there is no existing lifecycle-timestamp precedent in this
  codebase to reuse verbatim; v2 introduces the first one, scoped narrowly to
  evaluation.
- The Designer bug is real and precisely located: `app/views/development.py`
  `python_agent_names()` returns `AgentRow.name`, which
  `app/services/agent_catalog.py` populates with `spec.display` (display
  name), not `spec.name` (discovery id). `app/agent_designer.py` passes that
  list into `EvaluationDialog`; `app/views/evaluation.py`'s
  `candidate_id()`/`baseline_id()`/`opponent_ids()` return those display
  strings directly; `app/services/designer_workflows.
  build_designer_evaluate_command` forwards them verbatim as CLI arguments.
  When display name != discovery id, `bytefray agents evaluate` receives a
  string `resolve_agent` cannot find.
- The fixed-output bug is real and precisely located:
  `app/agent_designer.py` hardcodes
  `self.battle_root / "runs" / "evaluations" / "designer-evaluation"`
  regardless of the selected plan.
- `AgentSpec` (`agents.py`) already carries both `name` (discovery id) and
  `display` (display name) — the catalog layer just doesn't expose `name` to
  the evaluation dialog today. No new discovery concept is needed, only
  wiring the field that already exists.

## 2. v2 identity payload

```python
def planned_identity_payload(
    candidate: AgentSpec,
    baseline: AgentSpec | None,
    opponents: Sequence[AgentSpec],   # ordered, request order, duplicates preserved
    seeds: Sequence[int],             # ordered, request order, duplicates preserved
    ticks: int,
    effective_conditions: EffectiveConditions,
    rules_compatibility_id: str,
    agent_api_version: int,
) -> dict[str, Any]: ...

evaluation_id = stable_id("evaluation-v2", planned_identity_payload)
```

This reuses `agent_identity()`/`stable_id()`/`canonical_json()` unchanged
(§8 of `agent_evaluation.md`), extended with three fields v1 never hashed:

- `effective_conditions` (§3) — so an `arena_size`/`win_mode`/weights
  override (once one ever exists) changes identity, not just seed/ticks.
- `rules_compatibility_id` (§4) — so a scoring/winner-resolution semantics
  bump changes identity even when nothing else did.
- an explicit `"identity_version": 2` marker, so a v1 and v2
  `evaluation_id` computed from *otherwise identical* inputs are
  byte-for-byte guaranteed to differ (they already would in practice because
  the payload shape differs, but the marker makes this a documented
  invariant, not an accident of hashing).

Excluded, exactly as v1 already excludes: timestamps, `output_dir`,
filesystem paths, outcomes, `complete`/lifecycle state, `project.version`
(package version — only `agent_api_version` and `rules_compatibility_id`
enter the hash; see §4 for why package version alone is insufficient but is
still recorded for humans).

v1 and v2 `evaluation_id`s occupy different identity spaces by construction:
a v1-produced default output directory (`runs/evaluations/<v1-id>`) is never
implicitly resumed by a v0.7 invocation of the same candidate/opponents/seeds
run under v2, because the v2 payload always differs from the v1 payload it
supersedes (different hashed fields, plus the `identity_version` marker).
This is intentional (§1's "v1 and v2 IDs cannot be mistaken for equivalent
contracts") and is a visible, documented behavior change from pure byte
compatibility, not a silent one: a user upgrading from v0.6.1 who reruns an
existing evaluation gets a **new** v2 artifact at a new path, and the old v1
artifact remains on disk, readable, untouched. `bytefray agents evaluate`'s
CLI contract (flags, output shape when `--output` is explicit) is otherwise
unchanged.

## 3. Effective conditions

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EffectiveConditions:
    tick_limit: int
    arena_size: int
    action_budget: int          # Config.instr_per_tick
    win_mode: str
    weights: dict[str, float | int]   # asdict(Config().weights)
    subject_slot: str = "A"     # TESTED_AGENT_SLOT
    opponent_slot: str = "B"    # OPPONENT_SLOT
    entrant_order: tuple[str, str] = ("A", "B")
    runtime_kind: str = "python"
    agent_api_version: int
    supervision: str = "unsupervised"   # evaluation always runs timeout=None
    tracing: str = "untraced"           # evaluation always runs trace=False
```

Recorded once per evaluation (constant across every cell, since
`agent_test.py` gives no per-cell override surface — §2 finding 4 of
`agent_evaluation.md` still holds). `seed` is deliberately excluded from
`EffectiveConditions` itself: it varies per cell and is already captured by
each cell's `seed`/`seed_index` (§6), not duplicated here. A stable,
opaque `effective_conditions_fingerprint = stable_id("evaluation-conditions",
asdict(effective_conditions))` is stored alongside the readable fields (per
Part I's "a stable fingerprint may be stored alongside the readable payload,
but must be reproducible from those fields").

`supervision`/`tracing` are recorded as fixed string labels, not booleans,
because they are read straight off `agent_evaluation.py`'s hardcoded
`timeout=None, trace=False` call (§10 of `agent_evaluation.md`) — future
evaluation code that makes these configurable would widen the enum, not
change its meaning.

## 4. Rules/runtime compatibility identifier

```python
# battle_engine/evaluation_history/models.py
EVALUATION_RULES_COMPATIBILITY_ID = "evaluation-rules-1"
```

A hand-maintained string, independent of `ProjectInfo.version`, bumped only
when one of these evaluation-relevant behaviors changes: `ScoringPolicy`'s
scoring semantics, `results.resolve_winner`'s winner-resolution rule,
Python-vs-Python scheduling order (`PythonEntrantController.run`'s fixed
A-before-B slot order), derived-seed policy (currently N/A — evaluation
seeds are always literal, never derived; if that ever changes, this ID must
bump), or match-runtime behavior that changes whether/how a cell completes.
Persisted verbatim in every v2 artifact's `effective_conditions` and hashed
into `evaluation_id` (§2). Documented here, not auto-derived from package
version, because a documentation-only release and a scoring-changing release
must not silently share an identifier, and because package-version equality
is not proof of complete environmental equality (interpreter version, OS,
dependency versions can still differ) — this ID intentionally covers *only*
evaluation/match comparability semantics, nothing broader.

v1 artifacts have no such field. Comparison (§9) treats its absence as
`unknown`, never as an implied match.

## 5. Lifecycle and provenance

Timestamp format: `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(timespec="microseconds")`
with the `+00:00` suffix normalized to `Z` (helper: `_utc_now_iso()`).
Example: `2026-08-09T14:03:07.123456Z`. All three fields use this format.

```json
{
  "created_at": "2026-08-09T14:03:07.123456Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-09T14:03:09.881002Z",
  "finished_at": null,
  "lifecycle_state": "running",
  "abort_reason": null,
  "abort_detail": null
}
```

- `created_at` is written once, in the very first atomic checkpoint, before
  any cell executes (so a crash during cell 1 still leaves discoverable
  lifecycle state — Part I's explicit requirement).
- `updated_at` is rewritten at every atomic checkpoint (unchanged per-cell
  cadence from v1's `_write_state` calls).
- `finished_at` is written only in the same atomic write that also writes
  final `aggregates`/`comparison` and flips `lifecycle_state` to
  `"finished"` — the same call, not two calls, so a crash between them is
  impossible by construction (Python single-process atomic-rename write).
- `lifecycle_state`: `"running"` (checkpointed, incomplete),
  `"finished"` (scheduler reached its terminal point — §5.1), or
  `"aborted"` (stopped early; `abort_reason` is currently only
  `"source_drift"`, `abort_detail` holds the typed diagnostic, §7).
- No-op resume (every scheduled cell already `completed`/trusted, nothing
  re-executed) still performs its final aggregate/comparison recomputation
  and writes `updated_at`, but MUST NOT change `created_at`, MUST NOT append
  a new execution context (§6), and MUST NOT change any cell's
  `execution_context_id`. This is asserted directly by test (§10).

### 5.1 `finished` vs. healthy

`lifecycle_state == "finished"` means the scheduler reached its terminal
point: every cell in the matrix reached `completed`/`failed`/`corrupted` and
final aggregation/comparison were written. It does **not** mean every cell
is scorable — `subject_init_failed`/`opponent_init_failed`/`failed`/
`corrupted` cells may coexist with `finished`. Health (§8) is a materially
separate axis; `complete: true` is retained only as a legacy/presentation
field with v1's original meaning (`len(cells) >= matrix_size`) documented as
such, not treated as v2's authoritative truth.

## 6. Execution provenance / execution contexts

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExecutionContext:
    context_id: str          # stable_id("evaluation-context", {...})
    bytefray_version: str
    agent_api_version: int
    python_version: str
    result_schema_version: int
    replay_schema_version: int
    rules_compatibility_id: str
    first_used_at: str       # UTC iso, first cell executed under this context
```

`evaluation.json["execution_contexts"]` is a list of these, keyed by
`context_id` (`stable_id` over every field except `first_used_at`, so two
runs under byte-identical environments share one context even across
separate invocations that both append to the same evaluation). Each newly
*executed* v2 cell records `execution_context_id` pointing at one of these.
Cells trusted from prior state on resume keep their originally recorded
`execution_context_id` unchanged. If the current process's context is not
yet present when a cell is about to be freshly executed, it is appended
before that cell runs (so the list only grows to contain contexts that
actually produced at least one cell). A no-op resume therefore never
appends anything (§5). An evaluation whose cells reference more than one
`execution_context_id` is not an error — it is a truthful record of a retry
performed under a different environment — and `show`/`list` must report
`"execution: mixed"` rather than picking one arbitrarily.

## 7. Source drift protection

**Revised after an independent adversarial review (v0.7 correction pass,
"B1") found that the original design below was not actually TOCTOU-safe as
written.** The original post-check recomputed its "expected" `match_id` by
calling `canonical_match_id`, which reads `spec.source_path` from disk
*at call time* — so a post-check running *after* a cell had already
executed would simply re-read whatever the file currently contained,
which could be the same (already-drifted) content the executor itself had
just read. Comparing two fresh reads of the same live file to each other
is vacuous; it does not detect that the file changed since the plan was
frozen. The strategy actually implemented by `EvaluationService` closes
that gap:

1. **Freeze once.** `EvaluationService.run` builds `planned_identities`
   (one `agent_identity()` call per candidate/baseline/opponent) exactly
   once, immediately after `_validate`, before any cell executes.
   `evaluation_id` is derived from that *same* dict (never a second,
   independent `agent_identity()` call) so the persisted
   `planned_identities` payload is structurally guaranteed to reproduce the
   recorded `evaluation_id` — the frozen snapshot and the id it produced
   can never independently drift apart.
2. **Pre-check** (`_detect_pre_execution_drift`, immediately before each
   cell's `test_agent` call). Re-resolve the cell's subject and opponent
   and compute `agent_identity(spec)`; compare against the *frozen*
   snapshot from step 1 (never re-derived from a live `AgentSpec.source_path`
   later). A mismatch on any field is drift.
3. **Post-check** (`_post_execution_identity_drift`, after a real match
   runs). Compares the frozen snapshot against the *executor's own
   recorded* per-entrant metadata (`NativeAgentResult.metadata`, embedded
   in the match result `test_agent` already returned) — not a second
   independent disk read. As of the v0.7 closure pass ("B1"), this
   comparison covers `source_sha256`/`api_version`/`agent_version`
   **and** `entry_point`/`local_source_fingerprint`: `python_runtime.
   PythonEntrantController`/`supervised_runtime.
   SupervisedPythonEntrantController` now additionally record, at load
   time, the entry-point string they actually resolved and imported from
   and a fingerprint of every local `.py` file under the agent directory
   they actually loaded from (`match_service._build_python_result` copies
   both into `NativeAgentResult.metadata`). This is what actually catches
   a source edit landing between the pre-check and `test_agent`'s own
   internal resolution/execution — including a same-file manifest
   retarget (`agent.yaml`'s entry point changed from one factory to
   another *within the same, byte-identical source file*, which
   `source_sha256` alone cannot see) or a local-helper-only edit (which
   neither `source_sha256` nor `entry_point` alone can see). Before this
   pass, the post-check compared only `source_sha256`/`api_version`/
   `agent_version`, so both of those specific edits — landing after the
   pre-check but before/during execution — could complete as an ordinary
   `completed` cell under the old frozen plan; see the adversarial
   regression tests `test_toctou_same_file_factory_retarget_is_detected`/
   `test_toctou_local_helper_edit_after_precheck_is_detected` in
   `test_agent_evaluation_v2.py`.

   **Lazy-import fix (second v0.7 closure pass).** The load-time
   `local_source_fingerprint` above is captured once, in
   `PythonEntrantController.__init__`/`SupervisedPythonEntrantController.
   _initialize_entrant`, *before* `reset()`/`act()` ever run. An agent
   that imports a local helper *lazily* — from inside `reset()`/`act()`,
   rather than at module load time — can have that helper file changed
   after the load-time fingerprint was captured but before the lazy
   import actually executes; the load-time fingerprint alone cannot see
   that, since the read that would notice the change has not happened
   yet when it is taken. `PythonEntrantController.run`/
   `SupervisedPythonEntrantController.run` now also compute a **second**,
   independent `local_source_fingerprint_final`, once the whole match has
   finished (every `act()` call for that match has already happened),
   over the identical deterministic scope as the load-time one, and
   `match_service._build_python_result` copies it into
   `NativeAgentResult.metadata` as `local_source_fingerprint_final`. The
   required invariant is now three-way, not two-way:

   ```text
   initial executor fingerprint == frozen planned fingerprint == final executor fingerprint
   ```

   Both the load-time and the post-match executor-recorded fingerprints
   must independently equal the plan's single recorded value; either one
   disagreeing is drift. See
   `test_lazy_import_helper_edit_after_initial_fingerprint_is_detected` in
   `test_agent_evaluation_v2.py`, which constructs a candidate whose
   `act()` lazily imports `helper.py` fresh on every call (via
   `importlib.util`, bypassing `sys.modules` caching) and makes its own
   behavior depend on the imported value, so the test can prove from the
   match's own observable outcome (`ticks_run == 1`, an immediate halt)
   that the *changed* helper was actually read and acted on by a real
   `act()` call — not merely present on disk — and that the evaluation
   still records `drift_detected`, never a valid `completed` cell.
4. **Initialization failures** get a *live re-resolve* against the frozen
   plan instead (no `NativeAgentResult.metadata` exists when an agent
   fails to initialize — `RuntimeDiagnostic` carries no identity fields).
   This still has its own read-after-the-fact race, but it is strictly
   narrower than not checking at all, and prevents a source edit that
   causes an init failure from being silently attributed to the original,
   frozen agent.
5. On first detected drift (any check, either role): **stop scheduling
   further cells immediately.** The drifted cell itself is recorded with
   `status="drift_detected"` and a typed diagnostic. Every cell that
   already completed validly before the drifted one is preserved
   unchanged. The final checkpoint sets `lifecycle_state="aborted"`,
   `abort_reason="source_drift"`, `abort_detail={role, agent_id, cell
   schedule_id, mismatched fields}`. No `finished_at` is written.
   `--retry-failed` never retries a `drift_detected` cell, even after the
   source is restored to its original content — the only correct recovery
   is a fresh evaluation.
6. A fresh evaluation (new plan/output, since the changed source now
   produces a different `evaluation_id` anyway) is required to continue
   evaluating the changed agent — the aborted artifact is never silently
   resumed or "fixed up" by rerunning inside the same output directory.

**Documented residual TOCTOU window (not claimed to be closed; narrowed,
not widened, by the second closure pass).** Executor-recorded evidence is
captured at exactly two points, each by a read separate from whatever
`reset()`/`act()` call last touched the same bytes:

* **load time**, inside `PythonEntrantController.__init__`/
  `SupervisedPythonEntrantController._initialize_entrant`, where
  `source_sha256`/`local_source_fingerprint` are computed once, right
  after the agent module is imported and before `reset()` runs;
* **post-match**, inside `PythonEntrantController.run`/
  `SupervisedPythonEntrantController.run`, where
  `local_source_fingerprint_final` is computed once, right after the tick
  loop finishes and every `act()` call for that match has already
  happened.

An edit that lands and then fully reverts to the originally-planned bytes
*before the nearer of these two reads captures it* is not detectable from
outside that call, and no check in this module can close it without
changing `python_runtime`/`supervised_runtime` themselves to fingerprint
on every single file access, which was deliberately not done (that would
turn a narrow identity check into a general instrumentation/provenance
system, out of scope per §20). Concretely, this covers two symmetric
cases: a durable edit-then-restore around load time (e.g. between
preflight and `PythonEntrantController.__init__`, restored before that
constructor's own read), and a durable edit-then-restore around the lazy-
import case above (read once by a genuinely executing lazy import, then
restored — by the agent itself, or by anything else with write access to
that path — before the post-match final fingerprint is taken). Both are
proven, not merely asserted: `test_toctou_edit_then_restore_is_not_falsely_
flagged` (load-time case) and
`test_lazy_import_helper_edit_and_restore_before_final_check_is_not_
falsely_flagged` (post-match case, which additionally proves via
`ticks_run == 1` that the transient value *was* read and acted upon before
reverting) both assert the match still completes normally, never falsely
flagged as drift. In practice this means: any edit that lands and *stays*
through the nearer of the two read points is caught — including entry-
point/manifest retargets, local-helper-only edits present at load time,
and local helpers imported lazily during `reset()`/`act()`, as of the two
v0.7 closure passes ("B1" and the lazy-import fix); only a transient edit
that fully reverts before its nearer read point remains undetectable, and
must not be, and is not, falsely reported as drift.

**Local-source-fingerprint scope.** `agent_identity.
local_source_fingerprint` hashes every `.py` file under an agent's own
`agents/<id>/` directory (§H3) — it is checked at planning time
(`evaluation_id`/pre-execution drift, comparing two live re-reads of the
plan snapshot against the current directory) *and*, since the v0.7 closure
passes, against **two** independent executor-recorded readings in
`NativeAgentResult.metadata` — `local_source_fingerprint` (captured at
load time, before `reset()`/`act()` run) and `local_source_fingerprint_
final` (captured after the whole match finishes, so any local helper
imported lazily during `reset()`/`act()` has already been read) — never a
second live re-read of the directory presented as executor proof. Both
executor-recorded readings must independently match the frozen plan's
single recorded value (see the three-way invariant above). The fingerprint
itself is explicitly scoped to files physically inside that one directory:
it does not follow `sys.path` imports, does not hash installed packages or
anything under `site-packages`, and cannot see a change to an *external*
dependency an agent's own code happens to import (a change to `numpy`'s
installed version, for instance, is invisible to this fingerprint and to
drift detection generally — see "External imports/dependencies limitation"
below).

**External imports/dependencies limitation.** Neither `source_sha256` nor
`local_source_fingerprint` covers anything outside an agent's own
directory. An agent that imports a third-party package, another agent's
code, or any file outside `agents/<id>/` can have its actual behavior
change when that external dependency changes, with no drift detected at
all — this is out of scope by design (§H3's "this is not general
provenance") and is not a residual bug to be closed later without a much
larger, deliberately-avoided general-provenance mechanism.

No source is embedded or snapshotted anywhere — drift detection is entirely
comparison of small identity fingerprints already computed for other reasons
(§2), never a copy of agent source.

## 8. Duplicate occurrence coordinates

Every v2 cell gains four fields beyond v1's:

```python
opponent_index: int              # 0-based position in request.opponent_ids
seed_index: int                  # 0-based position in request.seeds
matrix_ordinal: int              # 1-based global position (was implicit in
                                  # schedule_id's hash input in v1; now explicit)
condition_occurrence_index: int  # 0-based count of prior cells for this
                                  # subject sharing the same (opponent_id, seed)
                                  # pair, in request order
```

`condition_occurrence_index` is the field cross-evaluation alignment (Part
IV) actually uses: two evaluations that both evaluate `opponent_ids=[
"seeker", "seeker"]` at `seeds=[7]` each produce two cells per subject with
`opponent_id="seeker", seed=7`; occurrence index `0`/`1` lets a comparison
align "first seeker@7 attempt" with "first seeker@7 attempt" deterministically
without relying on `schedule_id` (evaluation-local only, §9) or directory
names. `schedule_id` keeps its existing v1 role (within-evaluation identity
for resume + Designer drill-down) unchanged; it is never read by the history/
comparison layer as a join key.

  "cells": [ "...v1 fields + §8 coordinates + execution_context_id + condition_fingerprint..." ],
  "aggregates": [ "...unchanged shape, always recomputable from cells..." ],
  "comparison": [ "...unchanged shape..." ],
  "complete": true
}
```

Every additive field beyond v1 is optional-safe to add without touching
`battle2.result`/`battle2.replay`/Agent API v1 — none of them are read.

## 10. v1/v2 domain model and adapters (`evaluation_history/`)

New Qt-free package, one focused module per concern (chosen over one
monolith because schema adaptation, discovery, and comparison are
independently testable and independently likely to grow):

```
battle_engine/evaluation_history/
    __init__.py        # re-exports the stable public surface
    models.py           # common typed domain model (Sec 11)
    v1_adapter.py        # read-only v1 -> common model
    v2_adapter.py        # read-only v2 -> common model
    discovery.py         # filesystem scan -> ArtifactListing
    health.py            # typed diagnostics (Sec 12)
    comparison.py         # alignment + verdicts (Sec 13)
    cli.py                # list/show/compare (Sec 14)
```

Depends only on `battle_engine.{agents,agent_evaluation,config,paths,
project_info,result_model,replay}` (identity/result/replay facilities it is
explicitly permitted to depend on) — never on `app.*`/Qt/pygame. A headless
import test (`test_evaluation_history_headless_imports`) asserts this.

### 11. Common domain model (`models.py`)

```python
class FieldConfidence(Enum):
    RECORDED = "recorded"        # read directly from the artifact
    RECOVERED = "recovered"      # derived from nested result.json (v1 only)
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"          # no evidence either way
    CONFLICTING = "conflicting"  # two evidence sources disagree
    VERIFIED = "verified"        # recorded value cross-checked against a
                                  # canonical artifact (replay digest, etc.)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ConfidenceValue(Generic[T]):
    value: T | None
    confidence: FieldConfidence

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ArtifactLocation:
    evaluation_json_path: Path        # absolute, resolved
    directory: Path                   # containing directory
    file_modified_at: str             # ISO UTC, explicitly labeled fallback

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SchemaSupport:
    schema: str
    schema_version: int
    supported: bool
    reason: str | None                # set when supported=False

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AdaptedCell:
    # subset of Sec 9's cell fields common to v1/v2, each wrapped where the
    # source artifact might not provide it (v1 lacks coordinates/context)
    schedule_id: str
    subject_role: str
    subject_id: str
    opponent_id: str
    seed: int
    status: str
    outcome: str | None
    opponent_index: ConfidenceValue[int]
    seed_index: ConfidenceValue[int]
    condition_occurrence_index: ConfidenceValue[int]
    score_subject: float | None
    score_opponent: float | None
    territory_subject: float | None
    territory_opponent: float | None
    condition_fingerprint: ConfidenceValue[str]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EvaluationSummary:
    location: ArtifactLocation
    schema: SchemaSupport
    evaluation_id: str
    candidate_id: str
    baseline_id: str | None
    opponent_ids: tuple[str, ...]
    seeds: tuple[int, ...]
    matrix_size: int
    lifecycle_state: ConfidenceValue[str]
    created_at: ConfidenceValue[str]
    health: "HealthReport"            # Sec 12
    cells: tuple[AdaptedCell, ...]
    rules_compatibility_id: ConfidenceValue[str]
    aggregates_recomputed: tuple[SubjectAggregate, ...]   # never trusted-as-is
```

`aggregates_recomputed` is **always** computed from `cells` by the adapter
(reusing `agent_evaluation.aggregate_cells` unchanged), never read verbatim
from the artifact's stored `aggregates` — this single rule satisfies both
"recompute when absent" (v1) and "derived fields must never override
contradictory canonical cell state" (Part I) with one code path instead of
two.

Unknown legacy v1 fields are represented as `FieldConfidence.UNKNOWN`, never
silently defaulted to a current-schema value (e.g. a v1 artifact with no
`rules_compatibility_id` produces `ConfidenceValue(None, UNKNOWN)`, not
`ConfidenceValue("evaluation-rules-1", RECORDED)`).

### 12. Health model (`health.py`)

```python
class HealthCode(Enum):
    HEALTHY = "healthy"
    FINISHED_WITH_INIT_FAILURES = "finished_with_init_failures"
    FINISHED_WITH_FAILED_CELLS = "finished_with_failed_cells"
    FINISHED_WITH_CORRUPTED_CELLS = "finished_with_corrupted_cells"
    UNFINISHED = "unfinished"
    SOURCE_DRIFT_ABORTED = "source_drift_aborted"
    MALFORMED_JSON = "malformed_json"
    WRONG_SCHEMA = "wrong_schema"
    UNSUPPORTED_VERSION = "unsupported_version"
    INVALID_REQUIRED_FIELDS = "invalid_required_fields"
    MISSING_NESTED_RESULT = "missing_nested_result"
    MISSING_REPLAY = "missing_replay"
    REPLAY_DIGEST_MISMATCH = "replay_digest_mismatch"
    RESULT_MATRIX_MISMATCH = "result_matrix_mismatch"
    UNKNOWN_LEGACY_CONDITION = "unknown_legacy_condition"
    NON_PORTABLE_ABSOLUTE_PATH = "non_portable_absolute_path"
    DUPLICATE_IDENTITY_LOCATION = "duplicate_identity_location"
    ARTIFACT_PATH_ESCAPE = "artifact_path_escape"                  # M4
    DUPLICATE_SCHEDULE_ID = "duplicate_schedule_id"
    DANGLING_EXECUTION_CONTEXT = "dangling_execution_context"       # H2 (v0.7 correction pass)
    FINISHED_MATRIX_SHORT = "finished_matrix_short"
    PLANNED_IDENTITY_INCONSISTENT = "planned_identity_inconsistent" # B1
    # H2 (v0.7 closure pass): further non-fatal structural diagnostics --
    # each is appended to a HealthReport alongside whatever else was found,
    # never raised (a single malformed *field*, unlike a missing
    # *structural* field required just to construct a cell, must never
    # abort the whole artifact or its siblings).
    INVALID_JSON_ROOT = "invalid_json_root"
    DUPLICATE_CONDITION_COORDINATE = "duplicate_condition_coordinate"
    CONDITION_FINGERPRINT_INCONSISTENT = "condition_fingerprint_inconsistent"
    MISSING_EFFECTIVE_CONDITIONS = "missing_effective_conditions"
    MISSING_RULES_COMPATIBILITY_ID = "missing_rules_compatibility_id"
    MALFORMED_MATRIX_ELEMENT = "malformed_matrix_element"
    INVALID_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_ENTRY = "invalid_execution_context_entry"
    # Second v0.7 closure pass: the `execution_contexts` *container* itself
    # can be the wrong type entirely (e.g. JSON `null`), distinct from one
    # malformed *entry* inside an otherwise well-typed list.
    INVALID_EXECUTION_CONTEXTS_CONTAINER = "invalid_execution_contexts_container"

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class HealthReport:
    codes: tuple[HealthCode, ...]     # every applicable code, never just one
    detail: tuple[str, ...]           # human-readable, index-aligned with codes
    verified: bool                    # True only after --verify's deep pass ran
```

**`HEALTHY` mutual exclusivity (v0.7 closure pass, "H2").** `adapt_v2_data`
now decides `HEALTHY` only once, after *every* semantic/structural check
has run and appended whatever codes it found — never mid-way through, as
soon as the lifecycle-state branch alone looked clean. Previously,
`HEALTHY` could be appended before later checks (e.g.
`FINISHED_MATRIX_SHORT`, `DUPLICATE_SCHEDULE_ID`,
`PLANNED_IDENTITY_INCONSISTENT`) ran, so an artifact could end up reported
as both `HEALTHY` and structurally inconsistent at once. `codes` is empty
only when nothing else was ever appended; `HEALTHY` is the sole code in
that case, never alongside another one.

**Identity-version compatibility (v0.7 closure pass, "M1").** The
`PLANNED_IDENTITY_INCONSISTENT` self-consistency rehash (comparing the
artifact's own `planned_identities`/`effective_conditions`/
`rules_compatibility_id` against its recorded `evaluation_id`) uses the
artifact's own recorded `identity_version` field, never the current
module-level `agent_evaluation.IDENTITY_VERSION` constant. A valid older
v2 artifact recorded under an earlier identity version (e.g.
`identity_version: 2`, predating H3's `local_source_fingerprint` addition
to `agent_identity()`) is rehashed with `identity_version: 2` and
validates correctly; recomputing it with today's `IDENTITY_VERSION` would
falsely flag it inconsistent purely because the identity scheme's version
number changed, not because anything about the artifact is actually
wrong.

**JSON root safety (v0.7 closure pass, "H2").** `discovery.adapt_any`
checks that a parsed artifact's JSON root is an object before inspecting
its `schema`/`schema_version` fields — valid JSON whose root is a list,
string, or number parses without error but has no `.get()` to call,
previously an uncaught `AttributeError` that would have aborted discovery
of every sibling in the same scan. It is now a typed `ArtifactReadError`
(`HealthCode.INVALID_JSON_ROOT`), isolated exactly like any other
malformed sibling.

**Execution-context validation (second v0.7 closure pass).** Two
concrete gaps remained in `v2_adapter.py`'s handling of a v2 artifact's
`execution_contexts` field, found by an independent review after the
first closure pass:

* *Case A — wrong container type.* `execution_contexts: null` is valid
  JSON but the wrong container type. `data.get("execution_contexts", ())`
  does **not** protect against this: the default only applies when the
  key is *absent*, and here it is present with value `None`, so the call
  returns `None` itself — a bare `for item in data.get("execution_contexts",
  ())` then raised an uncaught `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not
  iterable`, aborting discovery of every sibling in the same scan (the
  same class of bug §H2's `INVALID_JSON_ROOT` fix closed one level up, at
  the whole-artifact root, but this field-level instance of it survived
  the first pass). Any non-list value (`null`, a string, a number, an
  object) is now normalized to an empty list up front, before any
  iteration touches it, with `HealthCode.INVALID_EXECUTION_CONTEXTS_
  CONTAINER` appended as a diagnostic; `execution_contexts` genuinely
  *absent* from the artifact remains legitimate (a v2 artifact predating
  execution-context recording) and is not flagged at all.
* *Case B — incomplete entries silently treated as healthy.* A context
  reduced to essentially `{"context_id": "..."}`, with every
  behaviorally-relevant runtime field absent, passed the first closure
  pass's own `INVALID_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_ENTRY` check, which only verified
  that `context_id` itself was a non-empty string — it never inspected the
  other six fields at all. Such an artifact could be adapted and reported
  `HEALTHY`.

Both are closed by one centralized primitive,
`evaluation_history.models.execution_context_is_valid`, rather than two
separately-drifting implementations:

```python
EXECUTION_CONTEXT_REQUIRED_FIELD_TYPES: dict[str, type] = {
    "bytefray_version": str, "agent_api_version": int, "python_version": str,
    "result_schema_version": int, "replay_schema_version": int,
    "rules_compatibility_id": str,
}

def execution_context_is_valid(context: Any) -> bool:
    # dict, non-empty string context_id, every required field present with
    # the expected type, AND context_id recomputed (exactly as
    # agent_evaluation.current_execution_context derives it) matches the
    # recorded value.
    ...
```

`v2_adapter.py` uses this to decide, per entry: `HealthCode.
INVALID_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_ENTRY` for anything that fails it (missing
field, wrong-typed field, or a `context_id` inconsistent with its own
semantic contents — a context that is structurally "complete" but not
trustworthy, since `context_id` is supposed to be a deterministic function
of exactly those six fields). Only entries that pass
`execution_context_is_valid` are exposed on
`EvaluationSummary.execution_contexts` at all — a malformed entry is
*never* surfaced as something `comparison.py` could find by id and treat
as a legitimate compatibility record. (`known_context_ids`, which drives
`DANGLING_EXECUTION_CONTEXT`, is intentionally unaffected by this
stricter filter — dangling-reference detection stays scoped to "does any
entry, valid or not, claim this id," a distinct question from "is this
entry trustworthy enough to compare against.")

`comparison.py`'s own `_context_by_id`/`_contexts_compatible` deliberately
do **not** call `execution_context_is_valid` (which would also require an
exact `context_id` recompute-match): a hand-built `EvaluationSummary` used
directly by a test fixture (as opposed to one round-tripped through
`adapt_v2_data`) has no obligation to carry a genuinely-recomputed
`context_id`, only a stable, unique one, and requiring recompute-equality
there breaks nothing for a real artifact (which `v2_adapter.py` already
filtered upstream) but would break legitimate fixtures that use a
readable label instead of an opaque hash. Comparison-time compatibility
is instead protected by `_contexts_compatible`'s existing per-field
presence/type check (§H3 below) — sufficient on its own for Case B, since
it independently requires all six fields present and typed on *both*
sides before treating two contexts as the same runtime — plus, for any
artifact that actually went through `adapt_v2_data`, the upstream
`execution_context_is_valid` filter, which means a malformed context
(including a `context_id`-inconsistent one) is never even reachable by
`_context_by_id` for a real comparison in the first place.

`codes` is a tuple, not a single enum, because multiple states can coexist
(e.g. `FINISHED_WITH_FAILED_CELLS` and `NON_PORTABLE_ABSOLUTE_PATH`
simultaneously) — this is the "don't let a single boolean flatten these
states" requirement (Part V) satisfied directly by the type.

### 13. Discovery (`discovery.py`)

```python
def default_roots() -> tuple[Path, ...]:
    return (get_data_root() / "runs" / "evaluations",)

def discover(
    *,
    roots: Sequence[Path] = (),
    artifacts: Sequence[Path] = (),   # explicit evaluation.json or directory paths
) -> ArtifactListing: ...
```

`roots` defaults to `default_roots()` when both `roots` and `artifacts` are
empty. Each root is scanned non-recursively one level deep
(`root/*/evaluation.json`), never recursing into arbitrary subdirectories or
following the pattern outside the given roots/explicit paths — matching
Part III's "do not recursively scan arbitrary disks or user home
directories."

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ArtifactListing:
    entries: tuple["DiscoveredEvaluation", ...]
    duplicate_identity_groups: tuple[tuple[str, tuple[Path, ...]], ...]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DiscoveredEvaluation:
    location: ArtifactLocation
    schema: SchemaSupport
    evaluation_id: str | None   # None only when schema/parse failed entirely
    summary: EvaluationSummary | None    # None on hard failure
    health: HealthReport
```

One malformed sibling never raises out of `discover()` — every failure mode
becomes a `DiscoveredEvaluation` with `summary=None` and an explanatory
`HealthReport`, never an exception propagating past that one entry (proven
by `test_discovery_malformed_sibling_does_not_abort_listing`). Two
locations sharing the same `evaluation_id` are both listed individually
*and* cross-referenced in `duplicate_identity_groups`; a selector (§14)
naming an evaluation ID that matches more than one location raises a typed
`AmbiguousSelectorError` requiring a path-qualified selector instead.

`file_modified_at` (filesystem mtime) is populated on every
`ArtifactLocation` and is the *only* place mtime is exposed; it is never
substituted for `created_at`/`updated_at`.

Default listing performs shallow health only (JSON parse + schema/field
validation + cell-count/coordinate consistency — no replay digest
verification, no nested result re-read beyond what v1's recovery already
needs). `--verify` (§14) performs the deeper canonical
`verify_replay_digest`/`verify_result_replay` pass, only for the specific
selected artifact(s), not on every discovered sibling — this is the "shallow
discovery health vs. selected-artifact/deep verification" split Part III
requires, and keeps default `list` fast regardless of how many artifacts
exist (§16 performance).

### 14. Comparison (`comparison.py`)

```python
def align(
    left: EvaluationSummary, right: EvaluationSummary, *, deep_verified: bool = False
) -> AlignedComparison: ...
```

**`deep_verified`** (added in the v0.7 correction pass, "B3") must be
`True` only when the caller has already run
`evaluation_history.verification.verify_summary` on *both* `left` and
`right` (i.e. `bytefray agents evaluations compare --verify`). It gates
reproducibility-anomaly and baseline-control-anomaly detection below —
see the corrected §14.1. An ordinary (non-`--verify`) comparison leaves
this `False`, and CLI/JSON output for that comparison must say plainly
that its evidence was not deep-verified rather than implying it was.

Orientation is always `right` relative to `left` — this is explicit in every
returned/printed structure, never an implicit positional convention alone.
Those names are caller-selected comparison roles, **not** a chronological
old/new guarantee: the Designer's initially selected evaluation is Left and
the picker choice is Right, regardless of their timestamps.

**Strict shared-condition fingerprint** (excludes candidate identity by
construction — candidate identity is compared and reported *separately* as
the experimental variable, never folded into the shared-condition key):

```python
def condition_key(cell: AdaptedCell, opponent_identity: dict, conditions_fp: str,
                   rules_id: str | None,
                   arena_alignment_id: str | None) -> tuple[Any, ...]:
    return (
        opponent_identity["agent_id"], opponent_identity["source_sha256"],
        opponent_identity["entry_point"], opponent_identity["api_version"],
        opponent_identity["local_source_fingerprint"],
        cell.seed, conditions_fp, rules_id, arena_alignment_id,
        cell.condition_occurrence_index.value, cell.orientation.value,
    )
```

`local_source_fingerprint` was added to the strict opponent key in the v0.7
closure pass ("B4"): without it, an opponent revision separated only by a
local-helper edit (the entry file's own bytes and `entry_point` both
unchanged) would strict-key-match and compare directly, silently
attributing any outcome delta to the candidate. With it, such a pair fails
to strict-match and falls through to the `changed_condition`/
`ambiguous_duplicate_group` classification below instead — never a direct
verdict.

Two cells align only when every element of `condition_key` matches exactly,
**and** both sides' `condition_occurrence_index` confidence is not
`UNKNOWN` (an unknown coordinate never compares equal to anything, including
another unknown — Part IV's "unknown required dimensions do not compare
equal"). `rules_id=None` (v1 without a compatibility field) never equals any
value, including another `None` from a different v1 artifact — two v1
artifacts with no rules ID are never silently treated as rules-compatible;
they can still be shown side-by-side descriptively (§14.3), just never given
a direct verdict.

Entrant orientation and arena-alignment methodology joined this strict key
in v0.9. An `opponent_first` cell never aligns to a `candidate_first` cell,
even when opponent/seed/occurrence coordinates match; an unknown orientation
or arena alignment fails closed in the same way as another unknown required
dimension.

For v1, `condition_occurrence_index` is recovered only when the artifact's
cell list, in file order, gives unambiguous, consistent per-(subject,
opponent,seed) counting evidence (i.e., no malformed/duplicate schedule IDs
disrupting the count); otherwise it is `UNKNOWN` for every cell in that
duplicate group, and that entire group becomes an explicit
`ambiguous_duplicate_group` in the result rather than a guessed pairing.

**Verdict** (only for aligned pairs where both cells are `is_scored`):

```python
def verdict(left_outcome: str, right_outcome: str) -> str:
    # identical mapping to agent_evaluation.classify, oriented right-vs-left
    ...   # "improved" | "regressed" | "unchanged"
```

`"inconclusive"` covers:

* either side not scored (init failure/failed/corrupted/missing);
* a pair whose two cells ran under materially different or unknown
  execution contexts (added in the v0.7 correction pass, "H2"; made
  conservative in the v0.7 closure pass, "H3" — equivalence cannot be
  established across incompatible or unknown runtimes, so **every**
  outcome verdict for that pair is downgraded to inconclusive with a
  `reason`, including `unchanged`. Earlier in v0.7, an `unchanged` verdict
  was left alone on the theory that "no observed difference" makes no
  cross-runtime equivalence claim — that reasoning is not applied for this
  pass; "no observed outcome difference under different/unknown runtimes"
  may still be displayed descriptively via the row's own outcome fields,
  but it is reported as `inconclusive`, never as a controlled `unchanged`
  verdict);
* when the comparison was run with `--verify` (`deep_verified=True`
  passed to `align`): a pair whose two cells did not **both** individually
  and actually verify (`AdaptedCell.verified is True` on both sides). This
  is a v0.7 closure pass fix ("B3") — previously `deep_verified` only
  gated reproducibility-anomaly detection (below); the ordinary verdict
  for a pair was still computed from outcome comparison alone even when
  one or both cells had failed or never completed deep verification. A
  `--verify` comparison whose evidence failed to verify must never leave
  an ordinary `improved`/`regressed`/`unchanged` verdict (or a non-zero
  `directly_comparable` count) standing for the affected pair; the
  top-level `deep_verified` field/label exposed to a caller (CLI text,
  `--json` output) is likewise `True` only when `--verify` was requested
  *and* verification actually succeeded on both sides — never merely
  because `--verify` was passed, and never when either side's
  `left_verify_error`/`right_verify_error` is non-`None`.

A **reproducibility anomaly** (§14.1) is a related but separate, narrower
classification layered on top of an `improved`/`regressed` row (via
`ComparisonRow.reproducibility_anomaly`, never by itself producing
`"inconclusive"`): it requires `deep_verified` *and* both individual cells
having actually verified (`AdaptedCell.verified is True`), not merely a
matching candidate identity fingerprint — a fingerprint match alone was
found to be an insufficient basis for this claim during the v0.7
correction pass ("B3") and no longer triggers it.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AlignedComparison:
    orientation: str                    # "right_relative_to_left"
    candidate_changed: bool
    candidate_diff: dict[str, tuple[Any, Any]] | None
    baseline_context: "BaselineContext"
    rows: tuple["ComparisonRow", ...]
    unmatched_left: tuple[AdaptedCell, ...]
    unmatched_right: tuple[AdaptedCell, ...]
    changed_condition: tuple[tuple[AdaptedCell, AdaptedCell], ...]
    ambiguous_duplicate_groups: tuple[tuple[Any, ...], ...]
    reproducibility_anomalies: tuple["ComparisonRow", ...]
    denominators: "ComparisonDenominators"
```

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ComparisonDenominators:
    left_total: int
    right_total: int
    condition_intersection: int
    directly_comparable: int
    improved: int
    regressed: int
    unchanged: int
    inconclusive: int
    unmatched_left: int
    unmatched_right: int
    changed_condition: int
    ambiguous_duplicate_groups: int
    corrupt_or_missing: int
```

Every denominator is always populated, even when zero — no field is omitted
because a bucket is empty (Part IV's "always expose denominators").

#### 14.1 Candidate semantics

`candidate_diff` is populated (non-`None`) whenever any planned candidate
identity field differs between left and right, regardless of whether
`candidate_id` (the logical ID) itself changed — a same-ID source edit and a
different-ID candidate both populate it, but `candidate_changed` is `True`
only for the logical-ID case, and the CLI/JSON explicitly labels that case
"different candidates" rather than presenting it as a revision (Part IV).

If `candidate_diff is None` (fingerprints identical) and strict conditions
match and the comparison ran with `deep_verified=True` *and* both cells on
that row actually verified individually (not merely "the `--verify` flag
was passed" — a specific cell can still fail to verify even under
`--verify`), but `outcomes differ` on an aligned row, that row is added to
both `rows` (with its plain verdict) and `reproducibility_anomalies`
(flagged) — never silently relabeled as `improved`/`regressed` without the
anomaly flag, and never flagged at all from evidence that was only read
and recomputed from each artifact's own recorded fields.

#### 14.2 Opponent semantics

An aligned row additionally carries `opponent_identity_changed: bool` and
`opponent_diff`. `condition_key` (above) already prevents source/entry-point/
API changes from aligning as the *same* row — an opponent identity change
therefore shows up as `changed_condition`, not as a row with a diff flag, by
construction. A rename-equivalent relaxation (same executable identity,
different logical ID) is **not** implemented in v0.7 — out of scope per Part
IV's "may be offered... only if the specification and CLI make that
relaxation visible," and no product requirement in this task asks for it;
documented here as a deliberate deferral, not an oversight.

#### 14.3 Baseline semantics

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BaselineContext:
    left_baseline_id: str | None
    right_baseline_id: str | None
    identity_status: str   # "absent_both" | "absent_one" | "same" | "changed" | "unknown_legacy"
    control_rows: tuple["ComparisonRow", ...]   # only when identity_status == "same"
    control_anomaly: bool   # requires deep_verified=True and both cells verified on the
                             # anomalous row (same gate as reproducibility_anomalies, §14.1) --
                             # never derived from a bare verdict != "unchanged" check
```

Baseline identity differences never block candidate-cell comparison rows
(candidate cells are independent matches — Part IV). When
`identity_status == "same"` and both baseline cell sets verify, baseline
cells are compared the same way candidate cells are (§14 verdict function)
purely as a control signal; if that control shows anything other than
`unchanged`, `control_anomaly=True` is set and surfaced prominently, since
an identical baseline producing different outcomes under identical
conditions indicates an environment/determinism problem, not a candidate
result.

### 15. CLI (`evaluation_history/cli.py`)

```
bytefray agents evaluations list   [--root PATH ...] [--artifact PATH ...] [--json]
bytefray agents evaluations show   <evaluation-id-or-path> [--root PATH ...] [--verify] [--json]
bytefray agents evaluations compare <left> <right> [--root PATH ...] [--verify] [--json]
```

Wired into `command.py._agents` as one more `if argv[0] == "evaluations":`
branch (mirroring the existing `evaluate`/`inspect`/`diverge` branches
exactly), lazily importing `battle_engine.evaluation_history.cli.main`. The
deprecated `battle2` alias reaches it through the existing shared dispatch —
no second implementation.

A bare `<evaluation-id-or-path>`/`<left>`/`<right>` selector is resolved:
if it parses as an existing filesystem path (file or directory containing
`evaluation.json`), it is used directly; otherwise it is looked up as an
`evaluation_id` against the discovered roots, raising `AmbiguousSelectorError`
(exit `2`) if more than one location matches.

**Exit codes** (documented here, pinned by test):

- `0`: the command executed and produced its requested result — for
  `compare`, this includes a result containing regressions or degraded
  sibling entries; for `list`/`show`, this includes results containing
  unhealthy/legacy entries, as long as the requested artifact(s) themselves
  were readable enough to report on.
- `1`: the specifically selected artifact/comparison could not produce a
  trustworthy requested result — `show`/`compare` on an artifact that fails
  to parse at all, `compare` with zero directly comparable cells and zero
  other explicit outcome buckets to report, or a `--verify` deep-integrity
  failure on the selected artifact.
- `2`: invalid arguments, an ambiguous/missing selector, or an incompatible
  request shape (e.g. comparing two paths that don't exist).

`list` itself never exits non-zero solely because a *sibling* (not the
selected artifact — `list` has no single "selected" artifact) is malformed;
malformed siblings are reported as rows with their health code, and `list`
exits `0` as long as it could enumerate the roots at all.

JSON output serializes the typed dataclasses above via a stable, explicit
`to_json_dict` on each (sorted keys where order is not semantically
significant; list order is always semantically significant and preserved).
No CLI human-text parsing anywhere in this package — JSON is produced from
the same typed objects the human renderer reads, never derived from the
human string.

#### 15.1 Deep verification (`verification.py`)

`--verify` (on `show`/`compare`) runs `verify_summary`, which calls
`verify_cell` on every `is_scored` cell (pending/failed/corrupted/
drift-detected cells are `eligible=False` — skipped, never silently
counted toward "verified"; a summary with zero eligible cells is never
vacuously reported as verified). As of the v0.7 closure pass ("H1"), one
cell's deep verification checks the complete relevant result envelope, not
a partial subset:

1. the cell's `artifact_dir`, and the replay filename `result.json`
   references, both resolve *contained* beneath the evaluation directory
   (§H5 below) — never merely joined;
2. the nested `result.json` exists and parses;
3. the replay's digest matches what `result.json` records;
4. the replay's own header record agrees with the result envelope it was
   published alongside (`match_id`, `result_id`) — a tampered header would
   otherwise pass unnoticed as long as the replay's byte digest still
   matched, since digest verification alone says nothing about the
   header's own field values;
5. the result's `result_id` (new in this pass) and `match_id` match the
   evaluation cell's own recorded values;
6. entrant order matches the expected `(TESTED_AGENT_SLOT, OPPONENT_SLOT)`;
7. the result's recorded seed matches the cell's recorded seed;
8. the result's winner is consistent with the cell's recorded outcome;
9. when the **candidate's or baseline's** planned identity was actually
   `RECORDED` (new in this pass — previously only the opponent's identity
   was cross-checked here, so a tampered candidate `source_sha256`/
   `entry_point`/etc., in either the plan or the result, went entirely
   uncaught), it matches the result's own per-entrant metadata;
10. when the **opponent's** planned identity was actually `RECORDED` (v2
    only — v1 identity is always `UNKNOWN` and is never silently treated
    as matching), it matches the result's own per-entrant metadata. Both
    identity checks (9 and 10) now compare `entry_point`/
    `local_source_fingerprint` in addition to `source_sha256`/
    `api_version`/`agent_version` (§7's B1 fields).

A cell fails deep verification (and is therefore `verified=False`,
excluded from any ordinary comparison verdict per §14's B3 rule) if *any*
of the above does not hold. `all_eligible_verified` is `True` only when at
least one cell was eligible and every eligible cell verified.

**§H5: replay filename containment.** A `result.json`'s `replay.filename`
is untrusted content this package does not control — a tampered result
could reference `../../../outside.jsonl`, an absolute path, an
alternate-drive path, or a symlink that escapes the evaluation tree. As of
the v0.7 closure pass, every replay reference (in `verify_cell` and in
`agent_evaluation._resumed_cell_mismatch`'s own resume-time replay check)
is resolved through the same containment discipline as any other nested
artifact path (`battle_engine.paths.contained_path`, the M4 discipline
already applied to `artifact_dir`) — a filename that resolves outside the
cell's own artifact directory is refused with a diagnostic, never
followed. A moved evaluation directory (with its contents moved alongside
it) still verifies correctly, since containment is resolved against the
directory path as passed in at call time, never a path baked into the
artifact.

### 16. Performance

Discovery/adaptation stays on-demand scanning (Part III's pinned decision;
no index). Measured methodology: synthetic v2 artifacts matching the
40-cell reference shape (1 candidate, 4 opponents, 5 seeds), written
directly (not executed) to avoid multi-minute real-match generation time,
over 10/100/1000-artifact populated roots, three untimed warm-up scans
discarded, five timed repetitions averaged, wall-clock, on this development
machine (Windows, this checkout's `.venv`):

| n artifacts | avg scan+adapt time | sample artifact size |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | ~18 ms | 20,763 B |
| 100 | ~182 ms | 20,763 B |
| 1000 | ~1,862 ms | 20,763 B |

This is roughly 5x slower per artifact than the v0.6.1 raw-JSON-scan
baseline already on record (10: ~3.7ms, 100: ~36ms, 1000: ~358ms) — expected,
since `list`'s default path now performs full typed adaptation (aggregate
recomputation via `aggregate_cells`, per-field `ConfidenceValue` wrapping,
health-code derivation) rather than a raw parse. Absolute time remains
well under two seconds even at 1000 artifacts, a population size well
beyond what a typical data root accumulates; this does not, on its own,
meet the "measurements demonstrate a real requirement" bar Part III sets
for introducing an index, so none was added.

### 17. Designer fixes (no history UI in this slice)

**Discovery ID vs. display name.** `AgentRow` (`agent_catalog.py`) already
carries the discovery id in `meta["name"]`; `python_agent_names()`
(`development.py`) is changed to return `(display, agent_id)` pairs (or an
equivalent typed row) instead of bare display strings, and
`EvaluationDialog` (`evaluation.py`) is changed so its combo/list widgets
display `display` but their `.currentData()`/associated `Qt.UserRole` carry
`agent_id`; `candidate_id()`/`baseline_id()`/`opponent_ids()` return the
discovery ids. `build_designer_evaluate_command` itself needs no change — it
already just forwards whatever strings it is given; the fix is entirely at
the selection-collection boundary. A regression test uses a fixture agent
whose manifest `display` differs from its directory name and asserts the
built CLI argument list contains the directory name.

**Fixed-output collision.** Before launching the `QProcess`, the Designer
now calls `EvaluationService.preflight(...)` in-process (Qt-free; it only
resolves agent manifests via `resolve_agent`, no agent code execution — the
same safety boundary the CLI's own `--dry-run` preflight call already
relies on) to compute this plan's actual default output directory
(`<data-root>/runs/evaluations/<evaluation_id>`), and passes it explicitly
via `--output` unless the user overrides the field. This preserves same-plan
resume (`preflight` is deterministic and side-effect-free, so calling it
twice for the same plan yields the same directory both times) while
eliminating the collision, using only the existing preflight/evaluation-id
architecture — no new parsing of arbitrary stdout, matching the prompt's
explicit "don't reintroduce fragile stdout parsing if a typed/preflight
solution exists" guidance. If `preflight` raises
`EvaluationConfigurationError` (unknown/invalid agent selection), the
Designer surfaces that error before ever spawning the process, rather than
launching a doomed `QProcess`.

Designer history UI (list/open/compare inside the Designer) is **deferred**
out of this slice: the domain/CLI layer above is substantial on its own, and
Part VII explicitly permits deferral when adding history UI would threaten
domain/CLI quality within the same slice. The deferred slice's shape (a
read-only "Evaluation History…" action reusing `EvaluationResultsDialog`/
`TraceInspectorDialog`/replay-open plumbing already built for `evaluate`) is
recorded here so a follow-up has a concrete starting point, not just a
placeholder.

**Landed in v1.1** (`docs/ROADMAP.md`'s "Evaluation Insight & Designer
Polish"), almost exactly as sketched above: **Tools → Evaluation History…**
opens `EvaluationHistoryDialog` (`app/views/evaluation_history.py`), a
read-only browser over `discover()`/`adapt_any()`/`align()`/`verify_summary()`
via a thin adapter (`app/services/evaluation_history_workflows.py`) that adds
no domain logic of its own beyond Designer-appropriate `data_root` scoping
and plain-text formatting mirroring `evaluation_history/cli.py`'s own field
selection verbatim. Cell drill-down ("Test in Agent Lab"/"Open Replay")
reuses `EvaluationResultsDialog`'s exact signal shape and the exact same
`AgentDesigner` handlers — no second execution/replay-launch path exists.
Two-run comparison (`EvaluationComparisonDialog`) and agent-revision
provenance inspection (`RevisionBrowserDialog`, including a live check of
whether an archived revision still matches an agent's *current* on-disk
source — an Area D capability the CLI itself doesn't expose) are also
implemented.

**Shipped in v1.3.0** (`docs/ROADMAP.md`'s
"Designer Workflow Completion"):
`EvaluationComparisonDialog` gains the comparison-row drill-down this
section deferred — "Test in Agent Lab"/"Open Replay" from a two-run
comparison row, reusing the same Designer execution/replay handlers as the
single-evaluation cell list. The signal now carries the concrete cell's
ticks and entrant orientation as well as subject/opponent/seed, so an Agent
Lab rerun reproduces the selected schedule shape: `opponent_first` swaps
physical CLI roles, while replay opens the selected artifact directly. A
historical rerun still uses currently installed agent source; the dialog
states that explicitly rather than implying an archived snapshot will run.

Directly comparable rows retain exact side-scoped schedule ids for this
in-process resolution. They are defaulted, `compare=False` fields on
`ComparisonRow` and are deliberately omitted from `to_json()`: this fixes
the case where candidate-first and opponent-first rows share the same
opponent/seed/occurrence coordinates without changing comparison JSON or a
persisted schema. Resolution by coordinate is only a compatibility fallback
for hand-built/older in-process rows and succeeds only when exactly one cell
matches; ambiguity fails closed.

The Side control calls the roles **Left (selected)** and **Right
(comparison)**, not old/new. A direct row offers both and defaults Right; an
unmatched cell offers its one real side; a changed-condition pair (one or
more effective conditions, rules/methodology fields, or opponent revision
differ) requires an explicit side choice because it is not like-for-like.
An ambiguous duplicate group is never actionable — no code path guesses a
pairing `align()` could not establish. Its guidance points to concrete Cells
lists or `bytefray agents evaluations show <id> --json` plus the recorded
`schedule_id`/`artifact_dir`; it does not claim the CLI accepts a
schedule-id selector.

Revision *restore* is also implemented for v1.3 — see
`docs/specs/agent_revision.md`'s corresponding note. The only CLI
comparison change is human-readable disclosure of the already-existing
`ambiguous_duplicate_groups` count; the `--json` shape is unchanged.
**Still deferred, unchanged from above:**
any evaluation-history indexing (the ~1.86s-at-1,000-artifacts on-demand-
scan profile this section already measured remains adequate; not re-measured
in v1.3 since nothing about discovery performance changed).

## 18. Compatibility

- No `battle2.result`/`battle2.replay`/Agent API v1 change.
- `tournament_service.py`/`match_service.py` are not modified.
- v1 `evaluation.json` artifacts remain fully readable and are never
  mutated by any history/discovery/comparison operation (enforced by tests
  that snapshot a v1 fixture's bytes before and after every operation this
  spec adds).
- `bytefray agents evaluate`'s existing flags/exit-code contract (§12 of
  `agent_evaluation.md`) is unchanged; only the artifact it writes gains
  `schema_version: 2` and the additive fields above.
- v1.3's side-scoped `ComparisonRow` schedule references are in-memory only
  and omitted from `to_json()`. The compare CLI's JSON keys, evaluation
  artifacts, result/replay schemas, and Agent API are unchanged.

## 19. Correction to `docs/specs/agent_evaluation.md`

§7's `schedule_id` prose describes hashing `(evaluation_id, role,
subject_id, opponent_id, seed)` without mentioning `ordinal`; the shipped
v0.6.1 code (`build_matrix`, verified directly) includes `ordinal` in that
hash specifically to keep duplicate cells' `schedule_id`s distinct (see the
inline comment at `agent_evaluation.py`'s `build_matrix`). This spec is
corrected as part of this task (§7's code block there gains the `ordinal`
key) rather than left stale.

## 20. Deferred / explicitly out of scope

Matches Part X's "explicitly out of scope" list verbatim: no revision
store, no embedded source snapshots, no generic provenance system, no
run-instance ledger, no database/index, no ranking/Elo/statistics, no
Designer charts/dashboards/tags, no Agent API v2, no scoring/rules redesign.
Also deferred within this slice specifically: Designer history UI (§17),
opponent rename-equivalence relaxation (§14.2), and exhaustive-permutation
test coverage for every bullet enumerated in the parent task's Part VIII
(the test suite covers every acceptance-criterion-bearing behavior with
focused tests per §21 below, not a combinatorial expansion of every listed
scenario).

## 21. Testing and validation criteria

Each behavior in §2–§17 above gets at least one focused test; the full list
is tracked in the implementation PR/commit series rather than duplicated
here verbatim. Minimum bar before this spec is considered satisfied:
`evaluation_id` determinism and its sensitivity to every §2 input;
lifecycle atomicity (pre-cell checkpoint exists, finished+aggregates+
timestamp are one atomic write); no-op resume provenance stability (§5);
source drift stopping the matrix and preserving prior cells (§7); duplicate
coordinate correctness including asymmetric multiplicity; v1 artifacts never
mutated; one malformed sibling never aborting discovery; strict condition
fingerprint excluding candidate identity; duplicate alignment never using
`schedule_id`; denominators always populated; CLI exit codes for all three
classes in human and JSON mode; Designer discovery-id and output-path fixes;
headless import check (no Qt/pygame pulled in by `evaluation_history`).
Full headless `python -m pytest`, both `mypy` invocations, and the
repository's configured Ruff checks must pass before this feature is
reported complete.
