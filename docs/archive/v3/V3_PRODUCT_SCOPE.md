# Bytefray v3.0 — Product Scope

This document defines the v3.0 product cycle's thesis, compatibility
freeze, phase plan, and non-goals. It links to, rather than duplicates,
the v3 Ruleset research record — see
[V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md](V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md) and
[V3_RESEARCH_CLOSEOUT.md](V3_RESEARCH_CLOSEOUT.md) for that evidence. See
[V3_PHASE0_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md](V3_PHASE0_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md) for the audit and
verification work that produced this scope.

## 1. v3.0 thesis

> **Bytefray v3.0 improves how users create agents, run experiments,
> understand matches, analyze strategies, and install/use the software,
> while preserving Ruleset-2 gameplay compatibility.**

Gameplay semantics are not an active v3.0 workstream. `bytefray-rules-2`
ships unchanged; `bytefray-rules-3` does not exist and is not created by
this cycle.

## 2. Ruleset compatibility position

```text
software version:   Bytefray 3.x
active gameplay:    bytefray-rules-2
Agent API:          v1
```

A Bytefray 3.x software release does not require `bytefray-rules-3`.
Ruleset identity is tied to match semantics, not to marketing/version
numbering — see [COMPATIBILITY.md](../../COMPATIBILITY.md)'s independent-axes
table, which already states this policy generally; this document only
confirms it applies to v3.0.

## 3. Research-closeout relationship

The v3 Ruleset research program (eight phases plus a closeout) is complete
and its evidence is preserved and indexed — see
[V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md](V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md). Its
conclusion, **no Ruleset change currently justified**, is why v3.0 is a
product cycle rather than a gameplay cycle. The research is not reopened by
this document; §8 below defines the only process by which it could be.

## 4. Five product workstreams

1. **Presentation / visual experience** — Replay Viewer, Agent Designer,
   branding, first-launch impression.
2. **Agent creation** — the Agent Designer create → validate → test →
   evaluate loop, and its CLI equivalent.
3. **Strategy analysis** — presentation of already-computed evaluation
   evidence (win rates, behavior profiles, capture attribution).
4. **Evaluation infrastructure** — the evaluation CLI/GUI workflow, presets,
   parallelism, history, artifact management.
5. **Distribution / installation / release quality** — packaging,
   installer, documentation accuracy, release qualification.

See [V3_PHASE0_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md](V3_PHASE0_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md) §§7–11 for the
current-state audit of each, and §12 there for the candidate
prioritization table.

## 5. Non-goals for the current cycle

* No new Ruleset merely for version-number symmetry.
* No `ATTACK`/`DEFEND` action.
* No locality (rejected by v3 Phase 2).
* No replication or sub-agents.
* No mutation or evolution mechanics.
* No scheduler rewrite.
* No defensive scoring event (rejected by v3 Phase 5A and Phase 6).
* No new core model.
* No Agent API v2.
* No BFScript/DSL unless independently justified.
* No distributed evaluation unless evidence requires it.
* No speculative rating system (Elo/Glicko/clustering/composite score).

These may be revisited later; none is a current v3.0 product commitment.

## 6. Phase plan

### Phase 0 — Product baseline & scope freeze
This phase. See [V3_PHASE0_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md](V3_PHASE0_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md).

### Phase 1 — Presentation / Replay Viewer

**Status: baseline capture and branding parity complete** — see
[V3_PHASE1_PRESENTATION_BASELINE.md](V3_PHASE1_PRESENTATION_BASELINE.md).
The social-preview asset and panel-init audit items below remain open.

* **Objective**: close the concrete presentation gaps the Phase 0 audit
  found — Replay Viewer branding parity with Agent Designer, a baseline
  screenshot/recording set across HUD modes (compact, 5+-entrant, narrow
  window) that does not currently exist, resolution of the long-deferred
  GitHub social-preview asset, and an audit of the defensive
  `except Exception` panel-initialization pattern in Agent Designer.
* **User-visible benefit**: consistent branding, an accurate visual
  baseline for future presentation work, a better first impression outside
  the product itself.
* **Probable files/components**: `client/src/battle_client/pygame_renderer.py`,
  `client/src/battle_client/hud_layout.py`, `app/widgets/designer_presentation.py`,
  `assets/branding/`, `docs/screenshots/`.
* **Dependencies**: none beyond Phase 0.
* **Exclusions**: no HUD *semantic* change — core integrity, capture, and
  score display logic are unchanged; no engine change.
* **Validation**: manual GUI walkthrough per this project's GUI-testing
  requirement, refreshed screenshots.
* **Ruleset-neutral**: yes.

### Phase 2 — Agent Designer / agent creation workflow

**Status: complete, scope narrowed by explicit direction** — see
[V3_PHASE2_AGENT_CREATION_WORKFLOW.md](V3_PHASE2_AGENT_CREATION_WORKFLOW.md).
Delivered: a second scaffold template (not a starter copy — see that
report §1 for why), a Development-tab Reload affordance wired into
Validate/Test, selectable status/error text, and a documented null finding
on the panel-init exception audit. Contextual in-app Agent API guidance
(the fourth candidate below) was not separately built — the annotated
template's inline comments serve that purpose for a first agent instead;
a dedicated help system remains open if evidence later shows the template
alone is insufficient.

* **Objective**: a starter-based "start from example" scaffold option (CLI
  and GUI both currently offer only a blank template), a watched-file or
  explicit-reload affordance for the Development tab's external-editor
  round trip, contextual in-app guidance for the Agent API concepts a
  first agent requires, and a preset-authoring workflow (presets are
  currently entirely hand-authored).
* **User-visible benefit**: faster create → test → iterate loop, lower
  domain-knowledge floor for a first agent, while preserving deterministic
  behavior and provenance.
* **Probable files/components**: `app/views/development.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/agents.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/evaluation_presets.py`,
  `docs/AGENT_AUTHORING.md`.
* **Dependencies**: none beyond Phase 0; independent of Phase 1.
* **Exclusions**: no change to validation/timeout containment semantics; no
  removal of the external-editor path (Designer source viewing stays
  read-only per its documented v2.0 decision); no Agent API change.
* **Validation**: GUI walkthrough of the full create → validate → test →
  evaluate loop; regression tests for any new scaffold path.
* **Ruleset-neutral**: yes.

### Phase 3 — Strategy analysis

**Status: complete** — see
[V3_PHASE3_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md](V3_PHASE3_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md). Delivered:
visual win-rate/behavior/capture/interaction-matrix widgets in both
`EvaluationResultsDialog` and `EvaluationHistoryDialog` (the latter
previously the thinnest of the four presentation surfaces despite being the
"drill deeper" workflow), a `--json` mode on `agents evaluate`, and both
disclosed v1.6 Phase 6 presentation defects resolved. `EvaluationComparisonDialog`
was left unchanged — scoped out, not opportunistically touched; a candidate
for a future pass.

* **Objective**: a genuinely visual (not merely re-labeled text) GUI
  presentation of win-rate confidence intervals, behavior-profile
  dimensions, and the capture/interaction matrix; a correlated "why did X
  win" view spanning evidence, behavior, and capture; resolution of the two
  presentation defects disclosed but left open at v1.6 Phase 6
  qualification; a structured (JSON) CLI output mode.
* **User-visible benefit**: users can understand key reasons for a matchup
  outcome without manually cross-referencing separate text blocks.
* **Probable files/components**: `app/views/evaluation.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/agent_evaluation.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/evaluation_group_analysis.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/evaluation_history/cli.py`.
* **Dependencies**: none.
* **Exclusions**: no new composite/opaque rating — evidence and behavior
  stay structurally independent, per this project's existing evidence-based
  caution against unsupported global ratings, unjustified Elo/Glicko, and
  clustering without demonstrated value (see
  [FUTURE_PLANS.md](../../FUTURE_PLANS.md)'s "Richer evaluation / statistical
  analysis" section).
* **Validation**: presentation reads already-canonical artifacts with no
  re-execution; no `evaluation_id`/schema change.
* **Ruleset-neutral**: yes.

### Phase 4 — Evaluation infrastructure

**Status: complete, scope narrowed by audit evidence** — see
[V3_PHASE4_EVALUATION_INFRASTRUCTURE.md](V3_PHASE4_EVALUATION_INFRASTRUCTURE.md).
A targeted audit of the evaluation CLI/GUI/history layer, done before
implementation, found the evaluation backend already richer than its GUI
management surface, and found no evidence supporting two pieces of this
section's original objective as first drafted: an evaluation-artifact
list/prune/archive command, and separating the research-motivated CLI flags
out of `agents evaluate`. Both are addressed below instead of being built.
Delivered: GUI parity for `--workers` in the Designer's evaluation dialog;
non-default "effective conditions" (arena size, action budget, kill weight,
experimental locality reach) disclosed in the Designer's evaluation-history
detail pane via the same interpretation `evaluations show` already uses (one
shared function, not a second definition of "non-default"); a non-destructive
"Open Evaluation Folder" action on `EvaluationHistoryDialog`; and a small
readability fix to the one ambiguous-comparison GUI path that previously
told the user to leave the GUI and run `evaluations show <id> --json`.

* **Objective (as revised by the audit)**: CLI/GUI parity for the one
  CLI-only evaluation control found to be safely GUI-exposable
  (`--workers`, execution-only, never identity-bearing); GUI disclosure of
  non-default "effective conditions" already computed and CLI-disclosed but
  previously invisible in the Designer's own history view; a low-risk
  artifact-folder-access affordance; a documented, evidence-based
  disposition for the v3-research-motivated CLI flags
  (`--arena-size`/`--instr-per-tick`/`--kill-weight`) rather than an
  unevidenced relocation of them.
* **Original objective, not pursued**: an evaluation-artifact
  list-with-size/prune/archive command. No supported evaluation-artifact
  delete, prune, archive, or filesystem-size-accounting capability existed
  anywhere in this layer prior to Phase 4, and the audit found no evidence
  (scale complaint, support burden, or otherwise) that one is needed yet;
  building it would also require a new recursive filesystem-stat walk,
  changing evaluation discovery's deliberately cheap (one-level,
  no-per-cell-read) cost profile. Deferred, not rejected outright — should
  be revisited if real evidence of a disk-usage problem appears.
* **Original objective, not pursued as originally framed**: separating the
  research-motivated CLI flags out of `agents evaluate`. No doc or
  compatibility commitment obligates this, their `--help` text already
  correctly discloses their research provenance and identity-bearing
  status, and moving them risks the exact bit-for-bit reproducibility this
  section's own exclusion already required protecting. Disposition:
  retained as advanced/experimental evaluation controls in the CLI,
  intentionally not added to the ordinary GUI evaluation workflow (their
  non-default effect is what P1's disclosure surfaces after the fact, not
  a control most users need before the fact).
* **User-visible benefit**: users can pick evaluation parallelism from the
  GUI without dropping to the CLI; a non-default-conditions evaluation
  reads as non-default in the GUI history view exactly like it already does
  in `evaluations show`, so a user is never misled into thinking a
  research-configured run is an ordinary one; users can jump straight to an
  evaluation's artifact folder from history instead of navigating there
  manually.
* **Probable files/components**: `app/views/evaluation.py`,
  `app/views/evaluation_history.py`,
  `app/services/evaluation_history_workflows.py`,
  `app/services/designer_workflows.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/evaluation_history/models.py`,
  `engine/src/battle_engine/evaluation_history/cli.py`.
* **Dependencies**: none; benefits from Phase 3's structured-output work if
  sequenced after it, but does not require it.
* **Exclusions**: no evaluation identity or schema change; the
  research-motivated flags' identity-bearing behavior
  (`docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE0_RESEARCH_BASELINE.md` §5,
  `docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE3_OFFENSE_PAYOFF_CHARACTERIZATION.md` §5) is unchanged;
  discovery/listing stays one-level and cheap (no directory-size column, no
  recursive stat walk, no pagination); no evaluation delete/prune/archive.
* **Validation**: existing evaluation artifacts remain loadable and
  identity-stable before and after; CLI and GUI disclose materially
  equivalent effective-condition information for the same artifact.
* **Ruleset-neutral**: yes.

### Phase 5 — Integration, distribution, qualification
* **Objective**: synchronize the stale version references in `INSTALL.md`,
  `docs/LINUX_INSTALL.md`, and `SECURITY.md` (all three still name a
  pre-2.0 release while `pyproject.toml` is accurate); investigate and
  disclose the unsigned-installer Windows SmartScreen/antivirus experience
  a new user is likely to hit (currently undisclosed anywhere, unlike the
  portable-ZIP data-root caveat which already is); evaluate whether a
  portable-first/non-admin onboarding path would reduce first-install
  friction; make an explicit, disclosed decision about macOS distribution
  scope rather than leaving it an unstated gap.
* **User-visible benefit**: accurate onboarding documentation; an informed
  (not accidental) trust/friction posture for new users; a clear, disclosed
  platform-support boundary.
* **Probable files/components**: `INSTALL.md`, `docs/LINUX_INSTALL.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `tools/installer.iss`, `tools/build_win.ps1`.
* **Dependencies**: benefits from Phases 1–4 landing first so packaging
  reflects the settled product, but is not strictly blocked by them.
* **Exclusions**: no packaging-format rewrite unless evidence from this
  phase's own investigation justifies one.
* **Validation**: full install/upgrade/uninstall lifecycle re-qualification,
  per this project's existing release-qualification precedent.
* **Ruleset-neutral**: yes.

### Phase 6 — Release candidate / final release decision
* **Objective**: integrate Phases 1–5, run full qualification (test suite,
  Ruff, mypy, GUI smoke, install lifecycle), and decide whether to cut an
  RC or add another phase.
* **User-visible benefit**: a shippable, qualified v3.0.
* **Probable files/components**: `CHANGELOG.md`, `pyproject.toml` (version
  bump — deferred to this phase per this repository's established
  precedent of not bumping version metadata until release preparation).
* **Dependencies**: Phases 1–5.
* **Exclusions**: no new feature work in this phase; qualification only.
* **Validation**: this project's existing release-qualification playbook
  (see recent `CHANGELOG.md` RC entries for the pattern).
* **Ruleset-neutral**: yes.

## 7. Compatibility contract

Unless a later approved decision says otherwise:

```text
Ruleset:
    bytefray-rules-2 unchanged

Agent API:
    v1 unchanged

Existing agents:
    remain executable where currently valid

Historical replays/results:
    remain readable

Canonical identities:
    no semantic break

Evaluation schema:
    no gratuitous break

Reference agents:
    behavior unchanged

Scoring:
    unchanged

Scheduler:
    unchanged

Core capture:
    unchanged
```

If a product feature later requires changing one of these, that is a
separate, explicitly gated design decision — not a side effect of UX work.

## 8. Ruleset-reopen gate

A Ruleset-research question may be reopened only if at least one of these
occurs:

* real user gameplay exposes a reproducible strategic limitation;
* new agent designs demonstrate an unhandled capability gap;
* a product feature requires semantic engine support;
* a separately approved research hypothesis is compelling enough to test.

Any such work starts as a new research program, following the same
hypothesis → minimal experiment → evidence → decision → architecture →
implementation discipline the v2 alpha and v3 programs both used. It does
not enter v3.0 implementation by default, and does not promise
`bytefray-rules-3` as its outcome. See
[V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md](V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md) §7 for the
currently open ideas a reopened program might draw from.

## 9. Success criteria

### Presentation
* Cleaner, evidence-baselined first-launch experience.
* Replay Viewer branding parity with Agent Designer.
* Responsive layout maintained at supported window sizes (already largely
  true; verified rather than assumed by Phase 1).

### Agent creation
* Fewer manual round trips from create → test → evaluate.
* A non-blank starting point available without hand-copying a starter
  agent.
* Preserved reproducibility/provenance throughout.

### Strategy analysis
* A user can identify the key reason(s) a matchup outcome occurred without
  manually cross-referencing separate CLI/GUI text blocks.
* No new unsupported composite score introduced to get there.

### Evaluation infrastructure
* Every CLI evaluation control available from the Designer, or a disclosed
  reason it is not.
* Large evaluation artifacts (thousands of files, tens of megabytes —
  already an exercised real-world scale) are manageable without OS-level
  tools.

### Distribution
* `INSTALL.md`/`docs/LINUX_INSTALL.md`/`SECURITY.md` name the actual
  current release.
* The installer-trust experience (SmartScreen/AV) is disclosed, whether or
  not it is changed.
* A macOS distribution position is stated, whether "not supported" or
  planned.

No arbitrary numeric UX target is set without a concrete measurement
method behind it.

## 10. Deferred future Ruleset research

See [V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md](V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md) §7 and
[FUTURE_PLANS.md](../../FUTURE_PLANS.md)'s "Future simulation / combat research"
section for the full, deliberately non-committal catalogue — including the
new "Agent lifecycle: mutation, evolution, and replication economics" and
"Execution-trace / intent semantics" candidates this Phase 0 cycle added.
None of it is a v3.0 commitment; each item requires its own
hypothesis-driven research program under §8's gate before any design work
begins.
