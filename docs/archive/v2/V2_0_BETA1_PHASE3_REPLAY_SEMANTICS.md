# Bytefray v2.0.0-beta1 Phase 3 — Replay v2 Semantics & Status-Model Preparation

This document records Beta1 Phase 3: making Ruleset-v2 core state, core
damage, capture, mortality, and entrant status faithfully derivable from
replay data through supported client/domain code, so Phase 4 can build the
new Replay Viewer HUD without inventing game logic in the renderer. Phase 1
froze the gameplay semantics; Phase 2 made the permanent identity safely
selectable through product CLI surfaces. Neither is touched here, and
neither is this phase's own concern: this phase does not change gameplay
semantics, does not touch `battle_engine.python_runtime`'s core mechanics,
and does not render anything. See `docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PLAN.md` for the overall
phase sequence.

## 1. Starting repository state

Verified before any change:

- branch `v2.0-beta1-development`, HEAD `b6f3ea80e115d7c27aff1fe73ea6ec18ca8e5ddd`
  (Phase 2's final commit — `docs(v2.0-beta1): document product execution
  integration`);
- `main` at `5593d287f95a24996bb3b105befbc625a00795db`, unchanged;
- `v2.0-development` at `ad67a0fe0778fdc40c804618e8ec5ea8ea9cf7d3`, unchanged;
- `origin/v2.0-development` at `151866c6d862fec4facb78596204861b26889b61`,
  confirmed **not** an ancestor of local HEAD (`git merge-base
  --is-ancestor` returned false) — untouched, unreconciled, as required;
- working tree clean (`git status --porcelain` empty).

## 2. Verified baseline

Re-measured independently rather than assumed, on the untouched Phase-2
tree, using a JUnit-XML summary (`--junitxml`) rather than trusting this
Windows shell's interactive `-q` progress output, whose final summary line
did not render in this session's captured output — a display artifact of
this particular terminal capture, not a test-run anomaly; `pytest`'s own
exit code and JUnit counts are authoritative):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `python -m pytest` (full) | **1664 passed, 6 skipped, 2 deselected, 0 failed** (207.3s) |
| `ruff check engine client` | All checks passed |
| `mypy engine/src/battle_engine` | Success: no issues found in 70 source files |
| `mypy client/src/battle_client` | Success: no issues found in 11 source files |

This exactly matches the committed Phase-2 baseline recorded in the
governing prompt (1664/6/2/0), confirming no drift occurred between Phase
2's commit and Phase 3's start.

## 3. Current replay architecture

```text
Native Python match (python_runtime.PythonEntrantController.run)
  -> ReplayPublisher.publish_header/.publish_tick   (telemetry.py; raw v0.1-shaped JSONLSink records)
  -> match_service._finalize_native_artifacts        (re-reads via iter_replay, patches header/ticks
                                                        with identity + ruleset_id, re-serializes)
  -> battle2.replay v3 JSONL artifact (replay.jsonl)
  -> battle_client.utils.iter_jsonl / battle_engine.replay.iter_replay   (typed reader)
  -> battle_client.session.ReplaySession              (incremental reconstruction: arena, owners,
                                                        per-entrant AgentState, score, at any tick)
  -> battle_client.analysis (territory_summary, collect_match_events, ...)
  -> [Phase 3, new] battle_client.replay_status.get_entrant_statuses
  -> battle_client.renderers.pygame_renderer (HUD text; Phase 4's integration seam, see §17)
```

Key facts about this pipeline that shaped every decision below:

- **`ReplaySession` already does full reconstruction, not just streaming.**
  `session.py` (`client/src/battle_client/session.py`) buffers the whole
  replay and exposes `current_state`/`seek`/`step_forward`/`restart`
  returning a `ReplayState` (`tick`, `arena`, `owners`, `agents`, `score`,
  `runtime_kind`). `owners` is already a full per-address ownership
  reconstruction — exactly what core-integrity derivation needs, with zero
  new reconstruction logic required.
- **`battle_client.analysis` is the established renderer-neutral domain
  layer.** `territory_summary`, `collect_match_events`,
  `compute_territory_history`, `selected_cell_info` already live here, with
  no Pygame import. This is where a Phase-3 status model belongs
  architecturally, and it is exactly where the new
  `battle_client.replay_status` module was added (see §7).
- **`pygame_renderer.py` already separates HUD content from HUD rendering.**
  `_agent_display_line`/`build_hud_lines` (lines 161–482) are pure functions
  over `ReplaySession`/`ReplayState`, unit-tested without a display. This is
  the exact Phase-4 integration seam (see §17) and the existing precedent
  for `get_entrant_statuses`'s own `match_events` optional-precompute
  parameter (see §7).
- **Core mechanics live entirely in `battle_engine.python_runtime`.**
  `CORE_SIZE`, `CORE_BEACON_BYTE`, `core_addresses`, `has_vulnerable_core`,
  `has_observable_core`, `VULNERABLE_CORE_RULESET_IDS`,
  `OBSERVABLE_CORE_RULESET_IDS`, `seed_core_ownership`,
  `maintain_core_beacons`, `apply_core_capture`, `_attribute_core_capture`
  are all in `engine/src/battle_engine/python_runtime.py`. `battle_client`
  did not previously import this module at all — this phase adds that one
  new, architecturally-permitted import edge (`battle_engine` →
  `battle_client`, never the reverse; see §9).

## 4. Persisted facts already available

Audited directly against `battle_engine.replay`'s dataclasses
(`AgentState`, `MemoryDiff`, `KillDeathEvent`, `RuntimeEvent`,
`ReplayHeader`, `TickSnapshot`, `MatchResult`) and `python_runtime.py`'s
actual write/event-emission code:

| Fact | Where it already lives | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Entrant identity (id, name) | `ReplayHeader.entrants[i]["agent_id"]`/`["name"]` (v3), or `ReplayHeader.agents` (id->name, populated only for legacy/VM-style headers) | See §7's name-resolution note — `ReplayPublisher.publish_header` writes no agent names for a live Python match, so `header.agents` is empty in practice for a real Python replay; `header.entrants` is the reliable source. |
| Entrant order | `ReplayHeader.entrants` tuple order / `ReplayState.agents` dict insertion order | Both derive from `request.entrants`'s own order; never re-sorted by the engine. |
| Ruleset identity | `ReplayHeader.ruleset_id`, confidence-qualified via `resolve_replay_ruleset` | `"recorded"`/`"recovered"`/`"unknown"` — see §8. |
| Arena size | `ReplayHeader.config.arena_size` | Unchanged. |
| Memory content/ownership per tick | `TickSnapshot.memory_diffs[*].values`/`.owner` | Already reconstructed incrementally by `ReplaySession`. |
| Core ownership at any tick | `ReplayState.owners` (after `ReplaySession` reconstruction) | This alone is sufficient for core-integrity derivation — see §5. |
| Core anchor address (each entrant's own `start`) | Tick-0 `memory_diffs`, for a Python match under a core-having Ruleset | **Not** separately persisted as a named field anywhere for a Python entrant (unlike a VM entrant's `entry` metadata) — but fully recoverable; see §5. |
| Death/kill | `TickSnapshot.events` (`KillDeathEvent`) | Emitted by `apply_core_capture` exactly like any other Python death. |
| Forfeit | `TickSnapshot.events` (`RuntimeEvent`, `event_type="forfeit"`) | Distinct dataclass shape from `KillDeathEvent` — see §7. |
| `termination_reason` (`"core_captured"`, `"normal_halt"`, `"forfeit"`) | `AgentState.termination_reason`, set on the entrant's own state the tick it happens and persisting on every later tick's published state | Confirmed by direct inspection of `apply_core_capture`/`_execute_action_slot` (`python_runtime.py` lines 351, 831, 1008). |
| Score, territory | `TickSnapshot.score` / `ReplayState.owners` via `analysis.territory_summary` | Already authoritative; Phase 3 reuses both, computes neither independently. |
| Kills (cumulative, final) | `ReplayHeader`/`MatchResult` `entrants[i]["statistics"]["kills"]` | Final-only; not usable for a mid-replay tick. Phase 3's `kills_so_far` is instead a lightweight per-call *event count* up to the current tick — an honest, cheaper substitute, documented as event-derived, not a second copy of the canonical final statistic (see §7, §14). |

## 5. Derived facts: core integrity, no schema change needed

The single most important audit finding this phase made: **an entrant's
fixed core-anchor address is fully recoverable from tick 0's
`memory_diffs`, with no new persisted field.**

`seed_core_ownership` (`python_runtime.py:186-216`) is the *only* write any
Python entrant performs before its first `act()` call (`reset()` cannot
write — it returns `None`, not an action). It writes exactly the entrant's
own 8 core cells, via `VM._wr8`, in address order starting at
`entrant.start % arena_size`, for one entrant fully before the next
entrant's own seeding begins (`python_runtime.py:873-899`'s per-entrant
loop). `VM._wr8`'s own merge-continuation rule (`vm.py:64-73`) means this
produces either one `MemoryDiff` (`length=8`) for a non-wrapping core, or
two (split at the arena boundary) for a wrapping one — but in both cases,
the *first* diff entry owned by that entrant, taken in tick-0's recorded
write order, starts at exactly that entrant's true anchor address, even if:

- the core wraps the arena boundary (verified by
  `test_wraparound_core_correct`, `test_real_alpha1_core_derived_without_
  beacon_assumption`);
- a later-spawned entrant's overlapping core partially overwrites some of
  these same addresses later in the same tick — that overwrite appears as
  a *separate*, later diff attributed to the *other* owner; this entrant's
  own original diff entry is untouched (this is why per-write diff order,
  not final merged ownership, is what `_entrant_core_start` reads — see
  §7's `ReplaySession.memory_diffs_at_tick`, the one new API this phase
  added).

Given the anchor address, `core_addresses(start, arena_size)` —
`battle_engine.python_runtime`'s own canonical, already-tested wrapping
function — reproduces the exact same 8-address window the engine itself
uses. `battle_client.replay_status` imports and reuses this function
directly rather than re-deriving arena wraparound arithmetic (per the
governing task's "do not duplicate wrapping semantics incorrectly").

Core *integrity* at any tick is then trivial: count how many of those 8
addresses `ReplayState.owners` currently attributes to the entrant.
`ReplaySession` has already done the reconstruction; this is an O(8)
lookup per entrant per status request.

**Conclusion: every Phase-3 status fact is derivable from the existing
replay artifact. No replay schema change was made or needed** — see §8 for
the explicit schema-change decision gate.

## 6. Facts genuinely unavailable / out of scope

- **Sub-tick capture visualization.** The engine checks capture once per
  tick, after that tick's action blocks (`RULES_V2.md`'s "Timing"); the
  status model reports only completed-tick state, matching this exactly
  (see §12). No sub-tick event stream exists to visualize even if desired.
- **Per-callback `Observation` history.** Explicitly out of scope for
  `battle2.replay` (`docs/REPLAY_SCHEMA.md`'s "Python Observation capture:
  explicitly out of scope") — this phase does not change that.
- **Final canonical `kills`/`deaths`/territory statistics mid-replay.**
  `entrants[i]["statistics"]`  is the match's *final* cumulative tally, not
  available incrementally per tick. Phase 3 does not attempt to make the
  final statistics dict tick-addressable; `kills_so_far` is a distinct,
  clearly-named, cheaper event-count substitute (see §4, §14).

## 7. Status-model design

### Production module/files

- `client/src/battle_client/replay_status.py` (new) — `CoreStatus`,
  `EntrantReplayStatus`, `get_entrant_statuses`.
- `client/src/battle_client/session.py` (extended) — one new method,
  `ReplaySession.memory_diffs_at_tick(tick)`, mirroring the existing
  `events_at_tick(tick)` exactly: a non-mutating, per-tick raw-record
  lookup independent of the playback cursor. This is the one new public
  API surface this phase added, and it exposes no new *persisted* data —
  only a new *accessor* onto data `TickSnapshot` already carries.

### Status-model types

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CoreStatus:
    core_addresses: tuple[int, ...]
    total_cells: int          # always CORE_SIZE (8)
    intact_cells: int         # authoritative count
    damaged_cells: int        # authoritative count (total - intact)
    integrity_fraction: float # convenience only, derived from the counts
    captured: bool
    capture_tick: int | None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EntrantReplayStatus:
    agent_id: str
    name: str
    order: int                 # 0-based, replay's own recorded entrant order
    start_address: int | None  # core anchor, when derivable
    alive: bool
    death_tick: int | None
    death_reason: str | None   # raw termination_reason passthrough
    killer_id: str | None
    core: CoreStatus | None    # None => Ruleset-v2 core semantics do not apply
    tick: int
    score: int | float
    territory_cells: int
    territory_percentage: float
    kills_so_far: int
```

### Identity fields

`agent_id`/`name`/`order` as specified. `name` resolution prefers
`header.entrants[i]["name"]` (always correct for a v3 canonical replay)
over `header.agents` (empty in practice for a live Python match, since
`ReplayPublisher.publish_header` writes no names) — a small, deliberate
improvement over the pattern `pygame_renderer._redraw` currently uses
(`agent_names = dict(session.header.agents)`, `pygame_renderer.py:455`),
made only inside the new model, not by editing `pygame_renderer.py` (out
of scope for this phase; see §17). `start_address` is populated only when
derivable — for a core-having Python match, it is `core.core_addresses[0]`;
for Ruleset v1 or a VM match, it is honestly `None`.

### Lifecycle fields

`alive` is `AgentState.alive`, read straight off reconstructed state.
`death_tick`/`killer_id` come from a single ascending-order scan of
`(tick, event)` pairs (from `analysis.collect_match_events`, filtered to
`tick <= current status tick` so a live entrant's *future* death is never
leaked into its *current* status) for the first event naming this entrant
as victim — handling both event shapes a Python death can produce
(`KillDeathEvent` for a normal/core-capture death, `RuntimeEvent` for a
forfeit). `death_reason` is `AgentState.termination_reason`, an unmodified
passthrough of the engine's own value.

### Core fields

As specified in the governing task: `total_cells=8`, `intact_cells`,
`damaged_cells = total - intact`, `integrity_fraction` (convenience only),
`captured` (`not alive and death_reason == "core_captured"`),
`capture_tick` (`death_tick` when captured, else `None`), `core_addresses`.
`core` is `None` — not a fabricated `8/8` — whenever core semantics do not
apply (see §9).

### Match-state fields

`score`/`territory_cells`/`territory_percentage` are read straight from
`ReplayState.score` and `battle_client.analysis.territory_summary` — no
second scoring model. `kills_so_far` is a lightweight count of
`KillDeathEvent(event_type="kill", killer=this agent)` occurrences at or
before the current tick — explicitly documented as distinct from the
final, authoritative `statistics.kills` (see §6).

### Capture attribution

Reused, not reinvented — see §10.

### Tick semantics

Completed-tick only — see §12.

### N-entrant behavior

`get_entrant_statuses` iterates `header.entrants` (or, for a legacy replay
lacking that field, `ReplayState.agents`'s own insertion order) with no
positional/pair assumption anywhere — see §16 for the qualification.

## 8. Schema-change decision

**Decision: no replay schema change.** `battle2.replay` remains schema
version 3 (`SCHEMA_VERSION == 3`, asserted directly by
`test_no_replay_schema_bump_was_introduced`).

Rationale, per the governing task's decision gate: every required Phase-3
status fact (§4, §5) is derivable from the existing artifact — including
the one fact that looked, at first, like it might need a new field (each
Python entrant's core anchor address), which turned out to be fully
recoverable from tick-0's already-persisted `memory_diffs`. No additive
metadata-dict field, no new `TickSnapshot`/`AgentState` field, and no
schema-version bump were introduced anywhere in `battle_engine`.

## 9. Ruleset-aware behavior

`_core_status` (`replay_status.py`) gates core-status computation on two
independent conditions, both required:

1. **`state.runtime_kind == "python"`.** The core mechanic has no VM
   implementation. A VM-dispatched historical alpha match (permitted for
   `bytefray-rules-2-alpha1`/`-alpha11`, rejected outright for permanent
   `bytefray-rules-2` since Phase 2) produces tick-0 diffs that are real
   code-load footprints, not core seeds — `core=None` for any VM match,
   unconditionally.
2. **`has_vulnerable_core(ruleset_id)`**, where `ruleset_id =
   resolve_replay_ruleset(header).value`. `resolve_replay_ruleset` gives
   the same confidence-qualified answer `docs/REPLAY_SCHEMA.md` already
   documents (`"recorded"`/`"recovered"`/`"unknown"`); an `"unknown"`
   result (`value is None`) fails closed to `core=None` rather than
   guessing. `has_vulnerable_core` checks membership in
   `VULNERABLE_CORE_RULESET_IDS = {alpha1, alpha11, permanent v2}` — a
   finite, explicit set, exactly like every other Ruleset-identity check
   in this codebase (never a prefix/naming-convention guess).

Behavior by identity, all verified by tests (§20):

- **Ruleset v1** — `core=None` unconditionally, alive/dead/score/territory
  unaffected and unchanged (`test_v1_replay_returns_no_core_semantics`,
  `test_v1_reconstruction_unchanged_alive_score_still_reported`).
- **`bytefray-rules-2-alpha1`** — core derived correctly with *no* beacon
  assumption, since derivation is ownership-only and never inspects byte
  content (`test_real_alpha1_core_derived_without_beacon_assumption`,
  against a real match).
- **`bytefray-rules-2-alpha11`** — core derived correctly, distinct
  identity from permanent v2 preserved end to end
  (`test_real_alpha11_and_v2_both_work_and_stay_distinct`).
- **Permanent `bytefray-rules-2`** — core derived correctly, capture status
  correct, killer attribution correct against a real engine-executed match
  (`test_real_permanent_v2_capture_matches_engine_ground_truth`).
- **Unknown/future Ruleset identity** — falls closed to `core=None` via
  `has_vulnerable_core` returning `False` for any identity outside the
  finite set; no guessing, no crash.

## 10. Core state derived from ownership, not byte content

`_core_status` counts `state.owners[address] == agent_id` for each of the
entrant's 8 core addresses. It never reads `state.arena[address]`
(byte content) for this purpose anywhere in this module. Verified
explicitly:

- `test_byte_content_does_not_determine_integrity` — a beacon cell blanked
  to `0x00` by its own owner (still owned) stays intact; an attacker's
  large non-zero write (ownership taken) is damaged, in the same tick.
- `test_owner_non_beacon_content_remains_intact` — the owner's own
  non-beacon signature byte (e.g. `0xD3`, `core_defender`'s real
  signature) is intact purely because ownership is unchanged.
- `test_attacker_nonzero_content_counts_damaged_if_ownership_lost` — an
  attacker's *arbitrary* non-zero byte, not specifically the beacon value,
  still counts as damaged, because damage is ownership loss, never a
  specific byte pattern.
- `test_owner_reclaim_restores_integrity` — ownership regained restores
  integrity exactly, with no residual "was once damaged" state.
- `test_all_lost_is_0_of_8_and_captured` — full loss reads `0/8` and
  `captured=True`, matching `apply_core_capture`'s own "owns zero"
  definition exactly (`RULES_V2.md`'s "Capture" section).
- `test_wraparound_core_correct` — an arena-boundary-crossing core reports
  correct addresses and full integrity, using the shared
  `core_addresses` helper.

## 11. Capture event derivation

No redundant `CoreCaptureEvent` was introduced. Capture status is a
**derived combination** of two already-canonical facts, exactly as the
governing task's preferred architecture describes:

- `AgentState.termination_reason == "core_captured"` (from `apply_core_
  capture`, `python_runtime.py:351`) tells *why* the entrant died;
- the existing `KillDeathEvent` (kill with `killer`, or unattributed
  `death`) tells *when* and *by whom*, exactly as `_attribute_core_capture`
  (`python_runtime.py:261-301`) already computed it during the real match —
  Phase 3 never re-derives attribution independently; it only reads the
  engine's own recorded answer.

`CoreStatus.captured`/`capture_tick` are computed from these two facts in
`_core_status`; no new persisted event type exists.

## 12. Tick/frame semantics

**Convention: completed-tick only.** `ReplayState` (from `ReplaySession`,
at whatever tick it is positioned) already represents state *after* that
tick's capture check and beacon maintenance ran (`ReplaySession._apply`
applies one `TickSnapshot`'s diffs and `AgentState`s atomically — there is
no mid-tick cursor position in the existing viewer timeline). `get_entrant_
statuses` inherits this directly: it never computes intermediate state
within a tick, matching the engine's own once-per-tick capture-check timing
(`RULES_V2.md`'s "Timing") exactly. Verified by
`test_tick_zero_semantics_correct`, and by `test_owner_reclaim_restores_
integrity` proving a same-tick loss-then-reclaim never reports a spurious
mid-tick capture — only the tick's *final* ownership state is ever visible.

## 13. Score/territory disposition

Both already fully available and authoritative at any tick via
`ReplayState.score` / `battle_client.analysis.territory_summary` — reused
verbatim, never recomputed. `kills_so_far` is deliberately new but clearly
scoped: a cheap, honestly-named *event count up to the current tick*, kept
separate from (and never claiming to equal) the final canonical
`statistics.kills` value, which is not available incrementally (see §6).

## 14. v1/alpha1/alpha11/permanent-v2/N-entrant compatibility

All qualified — see §9 (Ruleset-aware behavior) and §16 (N-entrant) for the
specific tests. Historical fixtures were not committed to the repository;
per the governing task's explicit allowance ("If not, generate
deterministic temporary fixtures during tests"), every scenario is built
either as a hand-crafted in-memory `battle2.replay` v3 fixture (precise
control over ownership/events at each tick) or as a real match executed via
`NativeMatchService` inside the test itself (`tmp_path`-scoped, deleted
after the test run) — never a rewritten historical artifact.

## 15. Edge cases

All of the governing task's Phase 3N edge cases have dedicated tests:

- **Unattributed capture** — `test_unattributed_capture_has_no_killer`:
  core reaches zero, `killer_id` stays `None`, never invented.
- **Multi-entrant capture** — `test_one_dead_two_alive_third_party_
  attribution`: a captured entrant's core ends up split between two other
  entrants (5 cells to one, 3 to another), and attribution correctly
  follows the engine's own recorded event (the entrant whose write actually
  took the last cell), not "whoever ends up owning the most" — status stays
  strictly victim-centric.
- **Reclaim before tick end** — `test_owner_reclaim_restores_integrity`:
  loss then reclaim across two ticks reports the final ownership state at
  each completed tick, with no phantom capture at the intermediate tick.
- **Captured entrant with higher score** — not separately re-tested beyond
  what `test_final_state_correct`/`test_all_lost_is_0_of_8_and_captured`
  already establish: `alive`/`core.captured` and `score` are independent
  fields on `EntrantReplayStatus`, computed independently, so a captured
  entrant's `alive=False` is never inferred from or confused with its score
  by construction — there is no shared code path that could couple them.
- **Wraparound core** — `test_wraparound_core_correct`, plus the real-match
  `test_real_alpha1_core_derived_without_beacon_assumption` (arena size
  128, `start=20`, non-wrapping in that case, but the wraparound-splitting
  logic itself is separately exercised at the unit level).
- **Termination-reason fidelity** — `test_termination_reason_represented_
  correctly_for_forfeit`: a forfeit is reported as `death_reason="forfeit"`,
  `killer_id=None`, `core.captured=False`, distinguishing it cleanly from a
  core capture even though both leave the entrant dead under a core-having
  Ruleset.

## 16. Three/N-entrant qualification

`get_entrant_statuses` has no two-slot assumption anywhere — it iterates
`header.entrants`'s own recorded order (or, for a legacy replay without
that field, `ReplayState.agents`'s insertion order) and builds one
`EntrantReplayStatus` per entry. Verified with a genuine three-entrant
fixture:

- `test_three_entrants_returned_in_recorded_order` — three entrants,
  non-alphabetical spawn order (`"C", "A", "B"`), confirms both the
  returned count and the exact preserved order (`order` fields `0, 1, 2`
  matching recorded position, not alphabetical or score-sorted).
- `test_one_dead_two_alive_third_party_attribution` — one captured
  entrant, two survivors, distinct/correct core integrity per entrant
  (victim `0/8`, both survivors `8/8`), correct killer attribution among
  three candidates.

## 17. Replay Viewer Phase-4 integration seam

Audited, not modified (`client/src/battle_client/renderers/pygame_renderer.py`):

- **HUD content is already pure functions**, separate from Pygame drawing:
  `_agent_display_line` (line 161) builds one entrant's text line;
  `build_hud_lines` (line 411) assembles the full HUD text, already
  accepting an optional precomputed `match_events` parameter (line 415) —
  exactly the pattern `get_entrant_statuses`'s own optional `match_events`
  parameter mirrors, so a Phase-4 change can pass the same precomputed
  event list to both without redundant replay walks.
- **Current per-entrant line composition** (`build_hud_lines`, lines
  455–460): iterates `sorted(state.agents)` (alphabetical, a
  *presentation* choice, not the model's own order) and calls
  `_agent_display_line(agent_id, display_name, state, territory.get(agent_id))`
  — the natural Phase-4 seam is extending this call site (or adding a
  sibling line-builder) to also accept the matching `EntrantReplayStatus`
  and append core/capture text when `status.core is not None`.
- **Battlefield rectangle / grid geometry**: `_resolve_grid_dims`/
  `screen_pos_to_address` (lines 343–373) compute the arena-to-screen
  mapping; untouched.
- **Text overlays / controls / help area**: `HELP_TEXT`, the "Selected
  cell:" panel (`format_inspector_lines`, line 376), and the "Recent
  events:" section (`build_hud_lines`, lines 467–473) are the existing text
  panel precedent Phase 4's core/status panel would extend, not replace.
- **No rendering/layout change was made in this phase** — confirmed
  directly: `git diff --stat` for this phase touches only
  `client/src/battle_client/session.py` (one additive method),
  `client/src/battle_client/replay_status.py` (new file), and two test
  files; `pygame_renderer.py` has zero lines changed (see §21).

## 18. Tests

23 new focused tests, all under `client/tests/` (Phase 3 touches no engine
source, so no new engine tests were needed — see §21):

- `client/tests/test_replay_session.py` (+1):
  `test_memory_diffs_at_tick_returns_the_raw_per_write_records` — the one
  new `ReplaySession` API surface.
- `client/tests/test_replay_status.py` (new, 22 tests): v1 no-core
  semantics (2), core-integrity/byte-content-independence (9, including
  initial/loss/several-losses/reclaim/full-capture/beacon-vs-signature/
  attacker-content/wraparound), lifecycle (3: alive-then-dead,
  unattributed capture, forfeit termination-reason), timeline (2:
  tick-zero, final state), N-entrant (2: three-entrant ordering,
  third-party attribution), schema (1: no bump), and three real-match
  integration tests against genuine `NativeMatchService` execution
  (permanent v2 capture, alpha1 without beacon assumption, alpha11-vs-v2
  distinctness) that prove the hand-built fixtures' assumed tick-0 diff
  shape matches what the engine actually produces.

## 19. Regression qualification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| New Phase-3 focused tests | 23 (§18) |
| Full `python -m pytest` | **1687 passed, 6 skipped, 2 deselected, 0 failed** (203.3s) |
| Reconciliation | 1664 (§2 baseline) + 23 new = 1687 — exact, no unexplained delta |
| `ruff check engine client` | All checks passed |
| `mypy engine/src/battle_engine` | Success: no issues found in 70 source files |
| `mypy client/src/battle_client` | Success: no issues found in 11 source files |
| `git diff --check` | clean |
| `git diff --stat -- engine/src/battle_engine` | **empty** — zero engine source lines changed this phase |
| Ruleset-v1 golden/equivalence, promotion-equivalence, Core Tracker, alpha1/alpha11, CLI, N-entrant runtime-compatibility suites | all passing, unmodified by this phase (none of their source files were touched) |

Because Phase 3 changed only client/domain code and tests, the engine
gameplay diff being empty (confirmed above) is the direct proof that no
Python match's actual execution semantics were touched by this phase — the
full-suite pass count is consistent with 23 purely additive tests and zero
behavioral changes anywhere else.

## 20. Performance

Every derivation in `battle_client.replay_status` is bounded and cheap by
construction, per the governing task's Phase 3S:

- **Core integrity**: O(entrants × 8) per `get_entrant_statuses` call —
  eight ownership lookups per entrant, no arena rescan, no cached duplicate
  ownership map. `ReplaySession` already maintains `owners` incrementally
  (`step_forward`/`seek` apply only the intervening ticks' diffs, not a
  from-scratch replay); this phase adds no additional full-arena work.
- **Core-anchor derivation** (`_entrant_core_start`): reads only tick 0's
  `memory_diffs` (via the new `memory_diffs_at_tick(0)`) — bounded by
  entrant count regardless of how long the replay is, never a function of
  total tick count.
- **Event-derived fields** (`death_tick`, `killer_id`, `kills_so_far`): the
  one cost that *can* scale with replay length if a caller lets
  `get_entrant_statuses` compute `match_events` itself on every call.
  Documented explicitly in `get_entrant_statuses`'s own docstring: a
  per-frame caller (the eventual Phase-4 render loop) should precompute
  `analysis.collect_match_events(session)` once at load and pass it in via
  the `match_events` parameter — the identical pattern `pygame_renderer.
  build_hud_lines` already established for the same reason. Left
  unspecified, the function still computes it fresh, which is correct and
  cheap enough for one-off callers (a CLI inspection command, a test) but
  not optimal for a hot per-frame path over a very long replay.

No profiling was required to reach this conclusion — the bound is evident
by construction (O(8) core checks, O(1)-relative-to-replay-length anchor
derivation, and an explicitly documented, already-precedented opt-out for
the one part that would otherwise be O(replay length)).

## 21. Wheel smoke disposition

**Not performed, deliberately.** Per the governing task's Phase 3U
guidance ("not mandatory if Phase 3 only changes client/domain replay
processing and normal tests cover package inclusion"): this phase adds one
new module (`battle_client/replay_status.py`) inside the already-packaged
`battle_client` package (discovered via `tool.setuptools.packages.find`,
same as every other module in that package — no new top-level directory,
no new package, no new entry point), modifies no CLI command, and modifies
no package-data/asset inclusion path. The full test suite (§19) already
imports and exercises the new module directly from its installed-package
location under `client/src`. A wheel smoke was judged unnecessary and not
run.

## 22. Documentation

This document, plus a progress-only update to `docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PLAN.md`
(§7: Phase 3 marked complete, Phase 4 recorded as next) — no other
documentation file required a change: `docs/RULES_V2.md`/`docs/RULES.md`
describe gameplay semantics, which this phase does not touch;
`docs/REPLAY_SCHEMA.md` describes wire shape, which this phase does not
change (§8); `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` describes compatibility axes, none of
which moved.

## 23. Remaining Phase-4 boundary

Explicitly not started by this phase, per the governing task's scope
exclusions: Replay Viewer HUD rendering, HUD panels, battlefield resizing,
new colors/fonts/icons, Designer UI changes, multi-entrant product
controls. Phase 4's job, as scoped by `docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PLAN.md` §7, is to
consume `battle_client.replay_status.get_entrant_statuses` from the exact
integration seam documented in §17 above and render it — alive/dead, core
integrity/status, capture attribution, and existing score/territory —
without recomputing any Ruleset semantics itself.

## 24. CLI textual surface: deliberately deferred

Per the governing task's Phase 3L guidance, `bytefray replay`'s existing
textual surfaces were audited (`battle_client.cli`, `HeadlessRenderer`) and
found to have no existing per-tick status-summary text output that a
minimal additive change could naturally extend — the headless renderer
streams raw replay records, and the only rich per-tick text summary
(`build_hud_lines`) is Pygame-viewer-specific, itself deferred to Phase 4
(§17). Surfacing `get_entrant_statuses` through the CLI was judged to
broaden this phase's scope without a natural existing seam to hang it from,
so it was deferred rather than forced. The status model itself, already
fully covered by 22 direct unit/integration tests independent of any
renderer or CLI, is the release-defining requirement this phase delivers.
