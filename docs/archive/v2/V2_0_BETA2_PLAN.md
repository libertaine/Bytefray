# Bytefray v2.0.0-beta2 — Evaluation & Multi-Entrant Methodology Plan

This is the working plan for `v2.0.0-beta2`, on `v2.0-beta2-development`
(branched from `main` at the exact post-`v2.0.0-beta1`-release commit — see
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md` §1–2 for the verified
branch lineage). It is not a roadmap duplicate — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` for
shipped-milestone history and `docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PLAN.md` for the prior
milestone this one builds on.

**Release status: shipped.** Package version `2.0.0b2` is tagged and
published as the `v2.0.0-beta2` GitHub prerelease. Final artifact, tag, and
publication evidence is recorded in the release workflow and linked from
the roadmap.

Beta1 froze Ruleset v2's gameplay semantics and integrated it into
supported execution/product boundaries, but deliberately left `agents
evaluate` v1-only, with no scheduler-order/placement/seed balancing and no
capture-aware evaluation output. Beta2 closes that gap:

> Beta2 evaluates the game. It does not change the game.

No gameplay, Agent API, or Ruleset-v2 semantic change belongs anywhere in
this milestone.

## Phase 1 — Ruleset-v2 1v1 Evaluation Methodology

**Status: complete and released in Beta2.** See
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md` for the full design
record and qualification report. Summary:

- explicit `agents evaluate --ruleset {bytefray-rules-1,bytefray-rules-2}`,
  with the historical v1 methodology preserved byte-for-byte when omitted
  or explicitly `bytefray-rules-1`;
- a standard, mechanically-derived 1v1 placement set (three deterministic
  conditions, expressed as fractions of arena size) for v2 methodology;
- a standard 5-seed default (`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`) for v2, matching alpha.10/
  alpha.11's own convention, always overridable;
- scheduler-order balancing (already present via entrant orientation)
  disclosed explicitly for v2 and kept structurally distinct from
  placement;
- every gameplay-relevant dimension (Ruleset, order, placement, seed,
  ticks) entering canonical evaluation/schedule identity, with v1 identity
  provably unchanged throughout;
- an additive, request-methodology-resolved schema/identity version
  (`SCHEMA_VERSION_V2`/`IDENTITY_VERSION_V2` = 5), never touching v1's
  existing `4`;
- capture/core interaction as a new, independent evidence category
  (`battle_engine.evaluation_capture`), kept structurally separate from
  win/loss/score/behavior;
- resume/comparison fail closed across any methodology change, using the
  existing architecture's own identity-driven gating — no new gating code
  was needed once identity was correct;
- real methodology characterization against Claimer/Hunter/Core Defender/
  Core Tracker/Reactive Core Defender, reproducing alpha.9/alpha.10's
  scheduler-order effect through the shipped product path for the first
  time.

This phase is 1v1 only. It does not implement multi-entrant evaluation —
see Phase 2 below and the Phase 1 report's §24/§29 for the identified
extension seam and explicit non-goals.

## Phase 2 — Multi-Entrant Evaluation Model

**Status: complete and released in Beta2.** See
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE2_MULTI_ENTRANT_EVALUATION.md` for the full design
record and qualification report. Summary:

- a generic entrant/seat/permutation/layout model (`EvaluationSeatAssignment`,
  `seat_label`, `enumerate_seat_assignments`, `EvaluationLayout`,
  `standard_layouts`), replacing 1v1-only vocabulary where a true seat
  model is needed, while leaving Phase 1's `EvaluationPlacement`/
  `orientation` (1v1) path completely untouched;
- real 3-entrant evaluation shipped through the existing `agents evaluate`
  CLI (`--group`, reusing `candidate_id`/`--opponents`/`--ruleset`/
  `--seeds` unchanged) — this phase delivered further than originally
  scoped, absorbing what the prior plan sketch called "Phase 3" CLI work,
  since it turned out to require no separate CLI surface;
- exhaustive seat-permutation scheduling for N=3 (6 permutations), informed
  directly by alpha.11's 84% 3-way permutation-sensitivity finding, with a
  disclosed (not solved) scaling boundary for larger N;
- winner semantics fully reused from the engine's own already-N-generic
  `resolve_winner` (survivor-only eligibility, alpha.4.1) — no second
  winner-resolution algorithm was written;
- a third additive schema/identity version (`SCHEMA_VERSION_V2_GROUP`/
  `IDENTITY_VERSION_V2_GROUP` = 6), leaving v1 (4) and Phase 1's pairwise v2
  (5) completely unchanged;
- resume/comparison fail closed across roster/seat/layout/methodology
  changes, again via the existing identity-driven gating with no new
  gating code;
- a genuine Phase 1 defect (an evaluation-history health-check rehash that
  never matched Phase 1's own identity payload, producing a false
  `planned_identity_inconsistent` on every 1v1-v2 artifact) was discovered
  during this phase's own characterization and fixed, with regression
  coverage;
- real characterization against two 3-entrant rosters (closing Phase 1's
  disclosed Hunter-coverage gap) and a self-play (duplicate-agent) roster,
  proving the architecture executes correctly through the real engine
  boundary, not just schedule generation.

Multi-entrant behavior/capture aggregate analysis is deliberately deferred
— see Phase 3 below.

## Phase 3 — Multi-Entrant Analysis & Strategic Metrics

**Status: complete and released in Beta2.** See
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE3_MULTI_ENTRANT_ANALYSIS.md` for the full design
record and qualification report. Summary:

- a new, entrant-symmetric sibling analysis module
  (`evaluation_group_analysis.py`) — per-entrant outcome (winner/
  surviving-non-winner/eliminated, never collapsed to a flat win/loss),
  score/territory/kill metrics, capture attribution and a directed
  captor-to-victim interaction matrix, seat/layout/seed sensitivity — all
  computed with no candidate id as an input, so candidate designation is
  provably presentation-only (`candidate_focused_view`, pure selection);
- a real, previously-undiscovered defect fixed: `SubjectAggregate.score_
  differential_avg`/`territory_differential_avg` were silently computed
  for group cells as if the (nonexistent) single opponent's score were
  zero, producing a number that looked like a real differential but
  wasn't — now `None` for group scopes, unchanged for pairwise;
- a second real defect found via this phase's own characterization and
  fixed: capture-tick values were reported as the match's final tick
  unconditionally, which only equals a specific capture's own tick when
  that capture ended the match — at N >= 3 that is very often false (the
  match keeps running with two-plus entrants alive); capture *facts* and
  *attribution* stay accurate, only the untrustworthy tick value is now
  withheld;
- `evaluations show` (both live-CLI and historical-artifact paths) now
  presents real per-entrant/seat/layout/interaction group analysis in
  place of the "deferred" placeholder, gated behind the same opt-in
  `--no-behavior` real-I/O discipline behavior/capture already use;
- real characterization against three 3-entrant, 5-seed (90-cell) rosters,
  including a direct re-examination of Phase 2's own "Core Tracker 2/54"
  finding — the expanded sample shows a materially different, seat- and
  seed-sensitive rate, demonstrating the original 3-seed sample was too
  small to characterize it reliably;
- Designer integration deliberately not attempted this phase (deferred,
  scoped for a later follow-up) — the analysis/CLI/history layer was
  completed and characterized first, per the milestone's own guardrail
  against letting GUI work drive analysis architecture.

## Phase 4 — Strategic Characterization

**Status: complete and released in Beta2.** See
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE4_STRATEGIC_CHARACTERIZATION.md` for the full
research record. Summary:

- an 11-roster, 990-cell pre-registered primary corpus (plus 3 pairwise
  1v1 controls) pointed Phase 3's analysis instrument at Phase 3's own
  open questions — Claimer's Matrix-A dominance, third-party/kingmaking
  effects, seat/layout/seed sensitivity, directed capture interactions,
  and pairwise-vs-group divergence;
- **Claimer's apparent dominance was matchup-specific, not universal**:
  its win rate ranges 36.7%-100% depending on roster composition,
  collapsing sharply whenever a dedicated search-based offense agent
  (Core Tracker/Core Seeker) is present — the same counter-strategy
  alpha.10/alpha.11 already established, confirmed still working under
  Beta2's own methodology at a larger sample;
- a real, reproducible kingmaking-like effect: a passive defensive third
  entrant wins 33-46% of matches purely by outlasting whichever of two
  active rivals a search agent eliminates, without attacking anything
  itself — and a real pairwise-vs-group divergence: Core Tracker beats
  both Claimer and Hunter individually in 1v1 but does not dominate
  either when facing them simultaneously;
- a real, consistent global seat bias (~18pp win-rate spread from seat A
  to seat C across the whole corpus, most plausibly last-write-wins-
  driven) was found and disclosed — real, but not large enough to
  overwhelm strategic differences, and already neutralized at the
  per-entrant level by the existing exhaustive-permutation methodology;
- a tick-budget methodology difference from alpha.11's own 1v1
  measurements was found and explained (not a defect — every within-
  corpus comparison in this phase used one consistent tick budget);
- no engine, scheduler, scoring, or agent code was changed — this was a
  pure characterization phase, and the one instrumentation audit
  performed found no defect.

**`STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT: PROCEED WITH DOCUMENTED CONCERNS`** — no
Ruleset revision is recommended before Beta2 qualification.

## Phase 4.1 — Pre-Qualification Review Remediation

**Status: complete.** See
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE4_1_PRE_QUALIFICATION_REMEDIATION.md` for the
recovery record and qualification evidence. An independent review found
five high-severity compatibility/correctness gaps after Phase 4. Phase 4.1
repaired group deep verification, self-play artifact health, conservative
multi-death capture timing, historical v1 schedule identity, group
comparison content identity, and duplicate/self-play presentation. It
also documented the deliberate start-aware Python match-identity
transition, retained v4/v5/v6 stored identities without a schema bump,
rejected pairwise orientation flags in group mode, and corrected the Phase
4 research prose/provenance boundary. The Phase 4 strategic assessment is
unchanged and its corpus did not require rerunning because no simulation
outcome or statistic used by that assessment changed.

## Phase 5 — Integrated Beta2 Qualification

**Status: complete; qualified and published.** See
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE5_INTEGRATED_QUALIFICATION.md` for the evidence and
release decision. The integrated pass re-established v4/v5/v6 identity,
resume, verification, comparison, self-play, generic-N, pairwise, history,
and CLI behavior; built and installed an isolated wheel; and completed the
full test, Ruff, mypy, client, and diff-check gates. No production change
or release blocker was required or found. Phase 4's documented concerns
(roster-composition effects at larger scale, a mechanistic confirmation
of the seat-bias hypothesis, and further kingmaking/non-transitivity
search) carry forward as future research rather than release blockers.

**Release decision: QUALIFIED FOR V2.0.0-BETA2 RELEASE.** The release-only
version and documentation preparation completed, the final artifacts were
built and qualified from release commit `b580ad2`, and the annotated tag and
[GitHub prerelease](https://github.com/libertaine/Bytefray/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta2)
publish that exact commit.

---

Additional Beta2 phases beyond the five above are not pre-planned; if
evidence from a later phase's qualification suggests the remaining scope
needs a narrower or wider phase boundary than sketched here, that revision
happens explicitly, the same way every other milestone in this project has
been re-scoped from real qualification evidence rather than a fixed plan.
(Phase 2's own plan sketch originally allotted four phases after Phase 1;
Phase 2 absorbed the CLI-workflow scope originally earmarked for a
separate phase. Phase 3's own findings are what introduced this revision's
new Phase 4 — "Integrated Beta2 Qualification" moved to Phase 5 rather
than being dropped.)
