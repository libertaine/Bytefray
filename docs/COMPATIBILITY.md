# Bytefray Compatibility Reference

This is a concise policy/reference document, not a duplicate of every
schema specification: it names the independent compatibility axes Bytefray
maintains, distinguishes supported contracts from historical experiments,
and gives a worked table for
deciding which axis a given change actually requires bumping. For the full
wire-level detail behind each axis, follow the links below rather than
expecting this document to repeat them.

## Current V5 product boundary

Bytefray `5.0.0a1` is the V5 product release; its process-agent gameplay
continues to use permanent `bytefray-rules-4` and Agent API v2. There is no
production Ruleset 5. Product versions, gameplay identities, Agent API
versions, and replay/result schemas are independent compatibility axes.

For ordinary CLI matches, an omitted ruleset selects v4 for an API v2
Python roster, v2 for an API v1 Python roster, and v1 for VM/blob entrants.
Mixed Python/VM matches and mixed API generations remain unsupported.
Both V4 alpha identities remain explicitly selectable for historical
reproduction. Designer Simple offers v2/v4; Advanced, Development, and
pairwise Evaluation also offer v4 alpha2, v4 alpha1, and v1. Group evaluation
requires v2. Development and Evaluation name workflows, not different
gameplay rulesets; V4 evaluation uses the same permanent gameplay with its
documented seeded-placement methodology.

Recorded replay playback reconstructs stored state without re-executing
agents. Keeping an identity readable and preserving its interpretation is
distinct from offering it for new matches; historical execution is also
retained for agent compatibility, tests, and reproducibility. The complete
inventory and proposed future presentation are in the
[Phase 4 audit](research/v5/V5_ALPHA1_MAINTENANCE_PHASE4_RELEASE_SURFACE_AUDIT.md).

## Stable-candidate contracts for 1.x

This section preserves the earlier 1.x contract inventory and its subsequent
additions. Its milestone terminology is historical; the current V5 boundary
is above, and the version-specific sections below define retained contracts.

- **Ruleset v1** (`bytefray-rules-1`) — the gameplay semantics described in
  [RULES.md](RULES.md).
- **Agent API v1** — the Python loading/lifecycle/`Observation`/
  `AgentAction` contract and its frozen deterministic RNG derivation,
  described in [AGENT_API_V1.md](AGENT_API_V1.md).
- **Result and replay current schemas** — `battle2.result` v1 and
  `battle2.replay` v3/v4, described in [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](RESULT_SCHEMA.md)
  and [REPLAY_SCHEMA.md](REPLAY_SCHEMA.md).
- **Evaluation current schema/history behavior** — `bytefray.evaluation`
  v4/identity v4 and the `evaluations list/show/compare` history behavior
  described in `docs/specs/evaluation_history.md`.
- **Agent revision identity/verification behavior** — the content-
  addressed revision store described in `docs/specs/agent_revision.md`.
- **Agent package format** (new in v1.2.0) —
  `bytefray.agent_package` schema version 1, a transport wrapper around
  one agent revision, described in `docs/specs/agent_package.md`. Newer
  than the other entries in this list, called out explicitly rather than
  silently folded in: package validity/integrity is a stable, versioned
  contract, but it deliberately makes no Ruleset-compatibility claim (an
  Agent API v1 agent isn't bound to one Ruleset the way a match/evaluation
  artifact is) and no code-trust claim (a valid package proves structure/
  integrity/provenance, never that the contained agent code is safe).
- **Canonical CLI surfaces where explicitly supported** — `bytefray run`,
  `bytefray tournament`, `bytefray replay`, `bytefray agents
  create/validate/test/evaluate/inspect/diverge/revisions/evaluations/
  export/import/package`, and their documented flags (README.md,
  `docs/AGENT_LAB.md`, `docs/TOURNAMENTS.md`).

## v4.0.0-alpha1 compatibility boundary

The v4 alpha adds three explicitly versioned, mutually consistent surfaces:

- Ruleset `bytefray-rules-4-alpha1` for Python process gameplay;
- Agent API v2 (`api_version: 2`) with `declare_processes()`,
  `MatchContextV2`, `ObservationV2`, and `ActionKindV2`; and
- `battle2.replay` schema 4 with process state.

These are alpha contracts, not silent replacements for the stable historical
ones. API-v1 Python entrants continue to run under Ruleset v1/v2 and write
schema-3 replays. API-v2 entrants run under a v4 Ruleset (alpha1 or alpha2)
and write schema-4 replays. VM/blob entrants remain Ruleset-v1 only.
Historical v1-v3 identity recipes and wire bytes remain frozen; current readers
accept their artifacts without inserting schema-4 fields or recomputing stored
IDs. See [AGENT_API_V2.md](AGENT_API_V2.md),
[V4_ALPHA1_DESIGN.md](V4_ALPHA1_DESIGN.md), and
[REPLAY_SCHEMA.md](REPLAY_SCHEMA.md).

## v4.0.0-alpha2 compatibility boundary

`bytefray-rules-4-alpha2` adds **one** new surface: a second v4 Ruleset
identity. Agent API v2 and replay schema 4 are unchanged, and no other schema,
identity recipe, or wire shape moves.

Alpha2 differs from alpha1 in exactly two gameplay semantics -- entrant core
placement is derived from the match seed under a minimum-separation contract
instead of the fixed evenly-spread seat layout, and an entrant's own processes
take their action slots in rotation instead of by declared-list priority. Both
are described in full in [V4_ALPHA2_DESIGN.md](V4_ALPHA2_DESIGN.md), which is
written as a delta against the frozen alpha1 freeze.

The two are **separate identities, never aliases**: the same agents, seed,
arena, and seat roster can produce different matches under each, and match /
result / replay identity already carries the Ruleset ID as a first-class axis
so the two never collide. Alpha1 keeps its exact frozen semantics, stays
registered and explicitly selectable everywhere a Ruleset can be named, and is
still what every persisted alpha1 artifact resolves to.

What *does* change for callers who name no Ruleset: an omitted `--ruleset`
with an Agent API v2 roster now resolves to alpha2 rather than alpha1. That is
the prerelease intent the omitted-Ruleset candidate list has always encoded --
"the newest intended v4 development Ruleset" -- and is the same kind of default
move that put alpha1 there when alpha1 was newest. An Agent API v1 roster still
resolves to `bytefray-rules-2`, and a VM/blob roster still resolves to Ruleset
v1, both unchanged.

Agent API v2 being unchanged means **every** API-v2 agent still loads and runs
under alpha2. What changes for some of them is whether their *strategy* still
works: an agent that hardcodes `own_core_base + arena_size // 2` as the
opponent's core will aim at empty memory under seeded placement. That is a
disclosed gameplay-balance change to a Ruleset, not a compatibility break --
the assumption those agents encode was a Ruleset-level historical accident,
never a documented Agent API contract. `hydra_alpha2` and `nemesis_alpha2` are
alpha2-targeted derivatives that acquire targets through the observation
contract instead; the historical `hydra` and `Nemesis` are unchanged.

`agents evaluate` deliberately does **not** accept alpha2. Its placement
conditions are an explicit, disclosed evaluation-methodology axis, and running
them under alpha2 would produce artifacts labelled alpha2 that actually ran
alpha1's fixed opposite placement. The existing fail-closed `--ruleset` guard
rejects alpha2 with a clear message; adopting it there needs a methodology
decision this Ruleset change does not supply.

## Separate compatibility axes

These axes are independent and must not be conflated — a change to one
does not imply, and should not silently piggyback on, a change to another:

| Axis | What it identifies | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Project/package version | The installable release (e.g. `0.10.0`). | `pyproject.toml` / `ProjectInfo.version`. |
| Agent API version | The Python agent programming contract, including RNG derivation. | `battle_engine.agent_api.AGENT_API_VERSION`. |
| Ruleset identity | The gameplay rules of the game itself. | `battle_engine.rules.BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID`. |
| Artifact schema versions | Wire shape of persisted artifacts. | `battle_engine.replay.SCHEMA_VERSION` (`battle2.replay`), `battle_engine.result_model` (`battle2.result`), `battle_engine.agent_evaluation.SCHEMA_VERSION`/`IDENTITY_VERSION` (`bytefray.evaluation`), `battle_engine.agent_trace` (`bytefray.agent_trace`). |
| Evaluation methodology fields | How `agents evaluate` measures agents (orientation coverage, arena-alignment/placement/layout disclosure, seed set, Ruleset selection, roster/seat assignment for multi-entrant), not gameplay itself. | `bytefray.evaluation`'s `orientation_mode`/`arena_alignment_mode`/`rules_compatibility_id`/`group`/`roster_agent_ids` (request-resolved as of v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 1/2) fields, and each cell's `placement_id`/`subject_start`/`opponent_start` (1v1) or `roster_agent_ids`/`seat_agent_ids`/`layout_id`/`seat_starts` (multi-entrant). |
| Agent revision identity | Content-addressed identity of one archived copy of an agent's source. | `battle_engine.agent_revisions`. |
| Source fingerprint versions | Deterministic hash-scope versioning for drift detection. | `battle_engine.agent_api.LOCAL_SOURCE_FINGERPRINT_VERSION`, `battle_engine.agent_revisions`' own fingerprint version. |
| Agent package format | Wire shape/versioning of the portable `.bytefray-agent` transport container itself — independent of the agent revision identity it wraps. | `battle_engine.agent_package.PACKAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION` (`bytefray.agent_package`). |

A gameplay-semantic change bumps exactly the Ruleset identity. A Python
programming-contract change (including an incompatible RNG-derivation
change) bumps exactly the Agent API version. A wire-shape change bumps
exactly the relevant schema version. None of these three should ever
require bumping either of the other two on its own — see the table below
for worked examples, including cases where a change legitimately requires
more than one axis at once.

## Ruleset identity

```python
BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID = "bytefray-rules-1"
```

defined in `battle_engine.rules`. See [RULES.md](RULES.md) for the full
Ruleset v1 contract and its bump policy.

## Bytefray v3.0 software version

Bytefray v3.0 is a software-version bump, not a Ruleset bump. The closed v3
research program (see
[V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md](archive/v3/V3_RULESET_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md)) found no
evidence justifying a gameplay-semantic change, so v3.0 software runs
`bytefray-rules-2` unchanged — exactly the independent-axes relationship
this document's own axis table already states (project/package version is
one axis, Ruleset identity is a separate one). See
[V3_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md](archive/v3/V3_PRODUCT_SCOPE.md) for the v3.0 compatibility
freeze and the gate that would need to hold before any future release
reopens Ruleset research.

## Ruleset v2

`v2.0.0-beta1` introduces a second Ruleset identity, permanent and stable as
of `v2.0.0`:

```python
BYTEFRAY_RULESET_V2_ID = "bytefray-rules-2"
```

defined in `battle_engine.ruleset_policy`, resolved through the same
fail-closed `resolve_ruleset_policy` seam as every other identity. See
[RULES_V2.md](RULES_V2.md) for the full Ruleset v2 gameplay contract and
`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PLAN.md`/`docs/archive/v2/V2_0_RULESET_V2_CANDIDATE.md` for the
evidence behind it.

- **Status: permanent, stable semantic identity** as of `v2.0.0`, promoted
  unchanged from the 2.0 beta/RC program's evidence-backed result. Like
  Ruleset v1's contract, it is not expected to change without new evidence
  and a deliberate, separately-versioned decision to revise it.
- **Agent API version is unaffected.** Ruleset v2 is a gameplay-semantics
  identity; manifest `api_version: 1` remains the supported Python programming contract for both Ruleset v1 and
  Ruleset v2. Ruleset identity and Agent API version are independent
  compatibility axes (see the table above) — bumping one never implies
  bumping the other.
- **The same Agent API v1 Python agent source may execute under more than
  one compatible Ruleset.** Nothing in the loading/lifecycle contract,
  `Observation`, or `AgentAction` changed; an agent written against
  `docs/AGENT_API_V1.md` runs unmodified whether the match resolves
  `bytefray-rules-1` or `bytefray-rules-2` (the only behavioral difference
  is what the shared arena does around it, not what the agent is allowed to
  do).
- **Runtime support: Python-runtime gameplay only.** Vulnerable Core and
  core observability are implemented only in
  `battle_engine.python_runtime`/`supervised_runtime`. As of `v2.0.0-beta1`
  Phase 2, `battle_engine.match_service.NativeMatchService` enforces this as
  an authoritative execution-compatibility boundary: a match requested under
  the permanent `bytefray-rules-2` identity with **any** VM entrant is
  rejected (`RulesetRuntimeUnsupportedError`) before any entrant executes
  and before any replay/result artifact is written — the Ruleset policy
  itself (`battle_engine.ruleset_policy.RULESET_V2.supported_runtime_kinds
  == frozenset({"python"})`) declares this restriction, and every production
  caller (CLI `run`/`tournament`/`agents test`, and anything built on them)
  inherits it from the one shared seam. **VM parity is not claimed** — this
  is a compatibility boundary, not a promise that VM entrants would see
  Vulnerable Core semantics if only they were allowed to run.
  `bytefray-rules-2-alpha1`/`-alpha11` are deliberately excluded from this
  restriction and keep their original behavior: the policy resolves and the
  match dispatches successfully with the core mechanic simply inert, exactly
  as before Phase 2 — preserving historical alpha-artifact reproducibility
  rather than retroactively rejecting matches those experiments already ran.
- **Artifacts record the exact Ruleset.** Every native result/replay written
  under Ruleset v2 persists the literal `"bytefray-rules-2"` string in its
  `ruleset_id` field (`ResultEnvelope`/`ReplayHeader`), exactly like every
  other registered identity — see "Persisted Ruleset identity on native
  result/replay artifacts" above, which applies unchanged to this identity
  (it required no new plumbing: `ruleset_id` was already generic).
- **Alpha Ruleset artifacts remain distinct historical experiment
  identities.** `bytefray-rules-2-alpha1` and `bytefray-rules-2-alpha11` are
  **not** aliased to `bytefray-rules-2` in either direction —
  `rules._RULESET_ALIASES` gains no entry for any of the three. Even though
  `bytefray-rules-2` shares its exact behavioral implementation with
  `bytefray-rules-2-alpha11` (the evidence being promoted is intentionally
  identical at promotion time — see
  `engine/tests/test_ruleset_v2_promotion_equivalence.py`), the three
  identities dispatch, hash into `canonical_match_id`, and persist
  separately, so no historical alpha artifact can ever be silently
  reinterpreted as a permanent Ruleset-v2 artifact, and evaluation
  comparison/resume both continue to fail closed across any pair of them.

## Ruleset v4 alpha1

`bytefray-rules-4-alpha1` is a distinct production alpha identity resolved by
the same fail-closed Ruleset policy seam. It supports Python entrants only and
requires every entrant manifest to declare Agent API v2. Production consumes
the fixed process declarations before tick 0 and supplies only
`ObservationV2`; an API-v1 entrant is rejected rather than adapted.

The identity is never aliased to Ruleset v1/v2 or the historical Ruleset-v2
research identities. New v4 executions persist the literal v4 identity and use
replay schema 4. Earlier executions keep their original identities, Agent API
v1 seed derivation, evaluation identity recipes, and schema-2/3 wire shape.
This is the historical-identity boundary: adding v4 does not re-bless any
artifact accidentally produced with installation-wide API/schema constants.

`battle_engine.ruleset_policy.agent_supported_by_ruleset` is the canonical
metadata-level compatibility decision for discovered agents. It considers the
manifest runtime kind and Agent API version together; `NativeMatchService`
applies the same policy before runtime dispatch, so a stale or programmatically
constructed v2/API-v2 or v4/API-v1 request fails before agent code executes.
Agent Designer's Simple Quick Match projects this boundary into the catalog:
as of `v4.0.0-rc1` Phase 2 it offers current gameplay only -- Ruleset v2 and
the permanent `bytefray-rules-4` identity (see "Ruleset v4" immediately
below) -- and shows only agents compatible with the selected Ruleset.
Historical Ruleset v1, v4 alpha1, v4 alpha2, and VM/blob selection remain
available through Advanced workflows, while Agent Development continues to
receive the complete discovered catalog. All three v4 identities are
distinguished by label ("current" and, for each alpha, "historical") because
they are identical on every other axis a selector could show: all three are
Python-only and all three require Agent API v2.

## Ruleset v4

`v4.0.0-rc1` Phase 2 introduces a third v4 Ruleset identity, permanent and
stable:

```python
BYTEFRAY_RULESET_V4_ID = "bytefray-rules-4"
```

defined in `battle_engine.rules` alongside its two alpha siblings and
resolved through the same fail-closed `resolve_ruleset_policy` seam as every
other identity. See [RULES_V4.md](RULES_V4.md) for the full Ruleset v4
gameplay contract and
[docs/research/v4/V4_RC1_PHASE2_STABLE_CONTRACT_PROMOTION.md](research/v4/V4_RC1_PHASE2_STABLE_CONTRACT_PROMOTION.md)
for the promotion evidence.

- **Status: permanent, stable semantic identity** as of `v4.0.0-rc1` Phase 2,
  promoted unchanged from the pre-RC research program's evidence-backed
  result (no further gameplay alpha found necessary; see
  [V4_PRE_RC_GAMEPLAY_EVALUATION_RESEARCH.md](research/v4/V4_PRE_RC_GAMEPLAY_EVALUATION_RESEARCH.md)).
  Like Ruleset v1/v2's contracts, it is not expected to change without new
  evidence and a deliberate, separately-versioned decision to revise it.
- **Gameplay-identical to `bytefray-rules-4-alpha2`, field for field.** Its
  `RulesetPolicy` (`supported_runtime_kinds`, `supported_python_api_versions`,
  `scheduler_mode`/`scheduler_chunk_size`/`scheduler_rotate_start`,
  `core_placement`, `process_selection`) is copied verbatim from alpha2's,
  not re-derived -- one semantic implementation
  (`battle_engine.scheduler.run_chunked_quota`, `battle_engine.
  process_runtime.ProcessMatchController`, and `python_runtime`'s seeded
  placement, all gated on those policy field values, never on the specific
  `ruleset_id` string) exposed under two compatibility identities. Proven
  by a release-blocking equivalence corpus, not merely asserted --
  `engine/tests/test_v4_stable_ruleset_equivalence.py` runs identical
  `MatchRequest`s under both identities across arena sizes, seeds, entrant
  counts, and real adapted-Alpha2/bundled-starter agents, and diffs the full
  replay content; every field compares equal except the four
  identity-bearing ones (`match_id`/`result_id`/`replay_id`/`ruleset_id`),
  which are asserted to legitimately differ.
- **Agent API version is unaffected.** Ruleset v4 is a gameplay-semantics
  identity; manifest `api_version: 2` remains the supported Python
  programming contract for all three v4 identities. Agent API v2 itself is
  now documented as the stable 4.x programming contract (see
  [AGENT_API_V2.md](AGENT_API_V2.md)), not merely an alpha-scoped one --
  no field, action kind, or semantic changed to make that declaration true.
- **Runtime support: Python-only, Agent API v2 only** -- identical to both
  alphas (`supported_runtime_kinds == frozenset({"python"})`,
  `supported_python_api_versions == frozenset({2})`). A VM/blob or Agent
  API v1 entrant is rejected (`RulesetRuntimeUnsupportedError`/
  `RulesetAgentUnsupportedError`) before any entrant executes, exactly as
  for both alphas.
- **Artifacts record the exact Ruleset and use replay schema 4**, exactly
  like both v4 alphas -- see "Persisted Ruleset identity on native
  result/replay artifacts" above, and
  [REPLAY_SCHEMA.md](REPLAY_SCHEMA.md), now documented as the stable v4
  replay contract rather than an alpha1-scoped one.
- **Alpha Ruleset artifacts remain distinct historical experiment
  identities.** `bytefray-rules-4-alpha1` and `bytefray-rules-4-alpha2` are
  **not** aliased to `bytefray-rules-4` in either direction --
  `rules._RULESET_ALIASES` gains no entry for any of the three. The three
  identities dispatch, hash into `canonical_match_id`, and persist
  separately, so no historical alpha artifact can ever be silently
  reinterpreted as a permanent Ruleset-v4 artifact, and evaluation
  comparison/resume both continue to fail closed across any pair of them.
  Alpha1 and alpha2 each keep their exact frozen semantics, stay
  registered and explicitly selectable everywhere a Ruleset can be named,
  and are still what every persisted alpha1/alpha2 artifact resolves to.
- **Default-resolution convergence.** An omitted `--ruleset` for an Agent
  API v2 roster now resolves to `bytefray-rules-4` (previously alpha2,
  previously alpha1) across every product entry point that resolves an
  omitted Ruleset through `battle_engine.ruleset_policy.
  OMITTED_RULESET_CANDIDATES` -- `bytefray run`, `agents test`, `agents
  evaluate` (as of `v4.0.0-rc1` Phase 1's F.6 fix), and `tournament` all
  converge automatically from this one table. An Agent API v1 roster still
  resolves to `bytefray-rules-2`, and a VM/blob roster still resolves to
  Ruleset v1, both unchanged.
- **Stable v4 evaluation.** `agents evaluate` on an Agent API v2 roster now
  runs schema-7 `ruleset_v4_seeded_placements` evaluation (`v4.0.0-rc1`
  Phase 1's methodology, unmodified) under `bytefray-rules-4` by default;
  explicit `--ruleset bytefray-rules-4-alpha2` remains fully supported and
  runs the identical methodology under its own honest identity. Explicit
  `--ruleset bytefray-rules-4-alpha1` remains its own historical
  fixed-placement methodology, unaffected.

## Ruleset-v2 1v1 evaluation methodology (v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 1)

`agents evaluate` gained an explicit Ruleset selector (now including
`bytefray-rules-1`, `bytefray-rules-2`, and
`bytefray-rules-4-alpha1`). This is an **evaluation methodology** change,
never a gameplay change — no Ruleset semantic, Agent API, or artifact
schema (`battle2.result`/`battle2.replay`) was touched. Two independent
compatibility guarantees hold:

- **Omitted, or explicit `bytefray-rules-1`.** Resolves to the exact same
  historical v1 evaluation methodology, byte-for-byte: identical
  `evaluation_id`/`schedule_id` hash payloads, identical
  `SCHEMA_VERSION`/`IDENTITY_VERSION` (4), identical matrix shape/size for
  the same request. No pre-Phase-1 evaluation script, preset, or resumed
  artifact changes behavior.
- **Explicit `bytefray-rules-2`.** A new methodology: a standard,
  mechanically-derived three-placement set, a standard five-seed default,
  and capture/core evidence — see
  [V2_0_BETA2_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md](archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md).
  Uses a second, additive schema/identity version,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION_V2`/`IDENTITY_VERSION_V2` (5) — there is no historical
  `bytefray-rules-2` evaluation artifact to preserve compatibility with,
  since evaluation had no Ruleset selector at all before this phase.

Placement (`EvaluationPlacement`/each cell's `subject_start`/
`opponent_start`) is a new, additive identity axis. `match_service.
canonical_match_id`'s Python-entrant metadata now includes `"start"`
whenever a Python entrant's start address is non-zero. This key's
*absence* at `start=0` keeps every historical **start=0** Python
`match_id`/`result_id`/`replay_id` byte-for-byte unchanged — but it is
**not** an unconditionally no-op addition for every historical Python
match, and it is not true that every historical Python match ever ran at
`start=0`. Non-zero Python starts have always been reachable: explicit
`bytefray run --a-start/--b-start/--c-start`, and — more consequentially —
every tournament entrant past the first, since `bytefray tournament`
(`tournament_cli`) has always placed entrant `index` at
`index * (arena_size // entrant_count)`, nonzero for every index but 0.
For any such non-zero-start Python match, this is a **deliberate,
one-time identity transition** (the same kind of transition
`canonical_match_id`'s own docstring documents for the earlier addition of
`BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID`), not a silently-safe additive fix:

- A Python `match_id`/`result_id`/`replay_id` computed by a pre-`v2.0.0-
  beta2` build for a non-zero-start entrant differs from what this build
  now computes for the identical inputs.
- Resuming a pre-Beta2 tournament artifact that used non-zero starts under
  Beta2 can therefore report `resumed_result_mismatch` — the artifact's
  own recorded `match_id` no longer matches the id `tournament_service`
  re-derives for the same scheduled match. This is the intended, fail-
  closed outcome (`tournament_service._resumed_result_mismatch` refuses to
  silently trust a result it cannot recompute the identity of), never a
  silent misattribution — see `TournamentService.run`'s `--retry-failed`
  handling for how such a match is re-executed rather than left
  `corrupted` indefinitely.
- `bytefray run` (single ad hoc matches, not resumed against prior state)
  is unaffected in practice: a non-zero `--a-start`/`--b-start` match
  simply gets a new, correctly start-sensitive identity going forward.

## Multi-entrant ("group") evaluation methodology (v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 2)

`agents evaluate --group` fields the candidate together with every
`--opponents` entry as one N-entrant roster per cell, instead of Phase 1's
pairwise "one cell per opponent." Requires `--ruleset bytefray-rules-2`;
every non-`--group` evaluation (v1 or Phase 1's pairwise v2) is completely
unaffected — see
[V2_0_BETA2_PHASE2_MULTI_ENTRANT_EVALUATION.md](archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE2_MULTI_ENTRANT_EVALUATION.md).
Uses a third, additive schema/identity version,
`SCHEMA_VERSION_V2_GROUP`/`IDENTITY_VERSION_V2_GROUP` (6) — as with Phase
1's version 5, there is no historical group-evaluation artifact to
preserve compatibility with. `EvaluationLayout`/`EvaluationSeatAssignment`
(roster/seat/layout) are new, additive identity axes for group cells only;
Phase 1's `EvaluationPlacement`/`orientation` (1v1) path is untouched.

This phase also fixed a defect discovered in its own manual
characterization: `evaluation_history`'s artifact-health self-consistency
check (an independent rehash of `evaluation_id`/`condition_fingerprint`
used to verify an artifact was computed honestly) had not been updated
when Phase 1 added `"placements"` to that hash payload, so it falsely
reported `planned_identity_inconsistent`/`condition_fingerprint_
inconsistent` on every Phase-1-produced artifact. This was a
*verification* bug only — no persisted `evaluation_id`/`schedule_id`/
`match_id` was ever actually wrong, and none was rewritten by the fix.

### Beta2 Phase 4.1 pre-qualification compatibility corrections

An independent pre-qualification review found two different historical-
identity cases that require different policies:

- **Historical v1 evaluation schedule identity is preserved.** Schema/
  identity v4 keeps the pre-Beta2 `schedule_id` payload exactly; the new
  `placement_id` key is present only for placement-aware v5 cells. For the
  fixed historical golden used by Phase 4.1, `evaluation_id` is
  `evaluation-v2_0677e78d27642c3c6f8fa62f`, `schedule_id` is
  `evaluation-cell_08c9393822c99186c03001ef`, and
  `condition_fingerprint` is
  `evaluation-condition_3fba859dabbcf03c7cb6048a`, matching commit
  `2076576`. Completed v1 cells with that identity resume normally.
- **Non-zero Python match starts deliberately transition.** Start is real
  gameplay input and remains part of canonical match identity whenever it
  is non-zero. Pre-Beta2 artifacts could contain non-zero starts through
  explicit `bytefray run --a-start/--b-start/...` flags and tournament
  spacing, so their `match_id`, and consequently `result_id`/`replay_id`,
  can differ under Beta2. An old tournament resume fails closed as
  `resumed_result_mismatch`; retry/re-execution is required. This is not
  silent corruption and no broad migration alias is provided.

Stored identity generations remain v4 (historical v1), v5 (Ruleset-v2
pairwise), and v6 (Ruleset-v2 group). Phase 4.1 changes group comparison's
*adapted, derived* metadata so non-candidate roster content participates in
the comparison key; it does not alter stored v6 `evaluation_id`,
`schedule_id`, or `condition_fingerprint` payloads.

Duplicate/self-play group execution and stored physical-seat evidence are
valid. Candidate-focused presentation now discloses logical-agent
multiplicity and labels rates as per physical entrant instance; when the
candidate occupies multiple seats, the first-occurrence legacy cell
`outcome` aggregate is suppressed as an ambiguous logical-candidate view.
The raw per-seat records remain authoritative and unchanged.

Group artifacts retain `EffectiveConditions.subject_slot="A"`,
`opponent_slot="B"`, and `entrant_order=["A", "B"]` as historical
pairwise compatibility sentinels. Group verification, comparison, and
analysis must not interpret them as N-entrant seat metadata; the recorded
`roster_agent_ids`, `seat_agent_ids`, layouts, and canonical nested result
entrants are authoritative. Removing or generalizing the sentinels is
deferred to a future identity/schema version because they are currently
identity-bearing.

## Stable v4 seeded-placement evaluation methodology (v4.0.0-rc1 Phase 1)

`agents evaluate --ruleset bytefray-rules-4-alpha2` now runs a fourth,
additive evaluation methodology rather than being rejected outright.
Implements docs/research/v4/V4_PRE_RC_GAMEPLAY_EVALUATION_RESEARCH.md's
accepted Sec H specification, on the maintainer-accepted evidence that
alpha2's whole gameplay change *is* seed-derived placement, so evaluating
it under the historical fixed-placement methodology would produce an
artifact labelled alpha2 that actually ran alpha1's fixed opposed
placement — see docs/research/v4/V4_RC1_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md
for the full implementation report.

- **Placement.** No new placement algorithm. Evaluation stops imposing
  explicit starts for this methodology and instead resolves each cell's
  placement through the same production `placement.
  resolve_direct_match_starts` seam `bytefray run` already uses
  (`agent_evaluation.resolve_v4_seed_geometry`), so a cell's placement is a
  pure function of `(arena_size, cell.seed)` and is automatically bound to
  the physical seat.
- **Sample count.** 8 deterministic placement samples by default
  (`STANDARD_V4_SEEDS = (1..8)`), mirroring `STANDARD_V2_SEEDS`'s own
  "default only when no explicit --seeds/--seed-range/preset is given"
  precedent. An explicit seed selection always overrides it.
- **Arena.** Pinned to `STANDARD_V4_ARENA_SIZE` (512) — a **ratified
  methodology constant**, not inherited from `Config().arena_size` (4096)
  the way every other methodology's omitted `--arena-size` still resolves.
  An explicit `--arena-size` that disagrees with the pin is rejected
  (`EvaluationConfigurationError`) rather than silently producing an
  artifact that still claims the standard methodology at a non-standard
  arena.
- **Orientation.** Both orientations, paired over the *same* resolved seat
  geometry per seed — the physical always-first-acting seat always gets
  the geometry's first resolved address, and orientation decides which
  role (candidate/baseline vs. opponent) occupies it. Never an
  independently-drawn placement for the reverse orientation.
- **Identity/schema.** A third, additive identity/schema recipe,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION_V4`/`IDENTITY_VERSION_V4` (7) — as with Phase 1's version
  5 and Phase 2's version 6, there is no historical `bytefray-rules-4-
  alpha2` evaluation artifact to preserve compatibility with, since
  evaluation rejected this Ruleset entirely before this phase. A new
  top-level `arena_alignment_mode` value, `"ruleset_v4_seeded_placements"`,
  sibling to `"fixed"`/`"ruleset_v2_standard_placements"`/`"ruleset_v2_
  group_standard_layouts"` — never reused, never collides.
- **Comparison.** No change to `evaluation_history.comparison`.
  `_condition_key` already includes `arena_alignment_id`/`rules_id`/
  `placement.value`, so a v4-seeded cell can never align with a cell from
  any other methodology, and two v4-seeded evaluations at different sample
  counts (say seeds 1–8 vs. 1–16) align on their shared prefix only.
- **`bytefray-rules-4-alpha1` is unaffected.** Alpha1 evaluation keeps its
  existing, historical v2-methodology behavior (`SCHEMA_VERSION_V2`/
  `IDENTITY_VERSION_V2` = 5, the three standard fixed placements) exactly
  as it has always had it — only alpha2, whose defining gameplay change
  the fixed methodology could not honestly evaluate, gets the new
  methodology.
- **Not introduced by this phase.** `bytefray-rules-4` (the permanent
  stable Ruleset identity) does not exist yet; this methodology is
  qualified against `bytefray-rules-4-alpha2` specifically, ahead of that
  promotion, so the evaluation contract is proven before the gameplay
  contract's permanent identity is assigned.

### F.6: evaluation-state integrity (write-side, all methodologies)

Independent of the methodology work above, and applying uniformly to
*every* evaluation methodology (v1/v2/v2-group/v4): an evaluation's
persisted top-level `lifecycle_state`/`complete` fields previously
reflected only whether the scheduler finished *attempting* every cell,
never whether any cell actually *succeeded* — so an evaluation whose every
cell failed (for example, `agents evaluate` on an Agent API v2 roster
resolving to an incompatible Ruleset, the defect that motivated this fix)
was still persisted as the bare `"finished"`/`"complete": true` a fully
successful evaluation gets.

`lifecycle_state` gains one new value, `"finished_with_failures"`, sibling
to the existing `"running"`/`"finished"`/`"aborted"`: written instead of
`"finished"` whenever the matrix finished scheduling but at least one
persisted cell's `status` is `"failed"` or `"corrupted"`. `complete` is now
defined as exactly `lifecycle_state == "finished"`. This is a **write-side
correctness fix, not a schema change** — no new JSON key, no identity-hash
payload change, and no historical artifact is reinterpreted; a pre-fix
artifact that already (incorrectly) says `"finished"` with failed cells
keeps reading exactly as it always has, including through
`evaluation_history`'s existing `HealthCode.FINISHED_WITH_FAILED_CELLS`/
`FINISHED_WITH_CORRUPTED_CELLS` derivation (now also recognizing the new
lifecycle state as equally "the scheduler is done" for that same
per-cell-status scan). A resumed evaluation that reconstructs historical
failed cells without re-executing anything reports the same truthful state
— never converts historical failure into a successful aggregate merely
because no new work was scheduled.

## Historical alias: evaluation-rules-1 ↔ bytefray-rules-1

`bytefray.evaluation`'s `EVALUATION_RULES_COMPATIBILITY_ID` (wire field
`rules_compatibility_id`, introduced in v0.7.0 as the literal string
`"evaluation-rules-1"`) is, as of v0.10 Phase 2, a derived alias of
`BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID`:

```python
EVALUATION_RULES_COMPATIBILITY_ID = BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID
```

This is justified by direct inspection of the gameplay-semantic source
history — see [RULES.md](RULES.md)'s "Historical relationship to
evaluation-rules-1" section for the git-history evidence — which shows the
gameplay semantics `"evaluation-rules-1"` was always narrowly scoped to
(scoring, winner resolution, Python scheduling order, derived-seed policy)
have been unchanged for the value's entire existence.

This alias does **not** rewrite history. An `evaluation.json` artifact
persisted before this alias existed still literally contains the string
`"evaluation-rules-1"` in its `rules_compatibility_id` field; it never
contained, and readers must never pretend it contained, the string
`"bytefray-rules-1"`. Historical wire field names (`rules_compatibility_id`)
are unchanged — only how the *current* value is computed changed, from an
independently maintained literal to a derived one. The practical effect
going forward: a gameplay-semantic change requires exactly one Ruleset
bump, not a Ruleset bump plus a separate hand-maintained evaluation-rules
bump.

As of v0.10 Phase 4, comparison behavior between two artifacts' recorded
values is explicitly **normalized**, not merely unchanged:
`battle_engine.rules.normalize_ruleset_id` maps the one established
historical alias (`"evaluation-rules-1"` → `BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID`) so that
`bytefray agents evaluations compare` can align a historical baseline
against a fresh run's cells directly, rather than reporting every pair as a
`changed_condition` merely because Phase 2 renamed the canonical spelling.
This is a small, explicit, finite lookup table (`battle_engine.rules.
_RULESET_ALIASES`) — **never** prefix/pattern matching — so an unrelated
Ruleset identity never opportunistically normalizes to another value. The artifact's own recorded
value (`rules_compatibility_id`/`EvaluationSummary.rules_compatibility_id
.value`) is exposed unchanged; only the *comparison alignment key* is
normalized.

## Persisted Ruleset identity on native result/replay artifacts

v0.10 Phase 4 makes `battle2.result`/`battle2.replay` independently
answer, from the artifact itself or an evidence-backed adapter, which
gameplay Ruleset produced one native match:

- Every current native (VM or Python) match writes its exact resolved
  `ruleset_id` into both `result.json`'s envelope
  (`battle_engine.result_model.ResultEnvelope.ruleset_id`) and the
  canonical replay's header record
  (`battle_engine.replay.ReplayHeader.ruleset_id`) — one discriminator
  per match, on the header only, exactly like `runtime_kind` already
  works (see [REPLAY_SCHEMA.md](REPLAY_SCHEMA.md)'s "Runtime-kind
  semantics"). The field itself was additive; schema 4 was later introduced
  independently for v4 process state (see
  [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](RESULT_SCHEMA.md)/[REPLAY_SCHEMA.md](REPLAY_SCHEMA.md)
  for the reader-tolerance evidence).
- A `redcode94`/pMARS result never *claims* Bytefray Ruleset v1 — but
  "absent" and "explicit `null`" are two different, precisely distinguished
  facts here, not interchangeable phrasing (see
  [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](RESULT_SCHEMA.md)'s "Ruleset identity" for the full
  detail): the current writer (`ResultEnvelope.as_dict()`, used by both the
  native and pMARS paths) always emits the `ruleset_id` key, so a current
  `redcode94` result has `"ruleset_id": null` — key **present**, value
  `null` — never `"bytefray-rules-1"`. Only a `result.json` written
  *before this field existed at all* (any pre-Phase-4 artifact, native or
  pMARS) has the key genuinely, structurally **absent**. Both decode to
  `ResultEnvelope.ruleset_id is None` at the Python level, and
  `resolve_result_ruleset` treats them identically via `mode`, which is
  what actually carries the "not applicable" fact — not whether the JSON
  key itself was present. pMARS produces no canonical replay at all, so
  this absent-vs-null question does not arise for `battle2.replay`.
- `battle_engine.result_model.resolve_result_ruleset`/`battle_engine.
  replay.resolve_replay_ruleset` attribute a confidence-qualified answer
  for an artifact that predates this field: `"recorded"` (field present
  and non-null), `"recovered"` (field `None`, but the artifact's own
  shape/mode is evidence-backed as Ruleset v1 — every native
  `battle2.result` v1 result, and every `battle2.replay` header whose
  `schema_version` is **exactly** `3`, since neither shape ever existed
  before the v0.3.0 "Bytefray Rename & Native Core" rewrite that
  established the currently-frozen gameplay semantics), `"unknown"` (no
  evidence — a genuine `battle2.replay` schema-version-2 header, which the
  pre-rename `v0.2.0` release's own canonical writer also produced, plus
  schema 4 or any future schema version greater than 3 when its required
  identity is missing — the check is exact equality, never `>=`, so an
  unrelated wire-shape bump is never silently also treated as a
  Ruleset-provenance fact), or `"not_applicable"` (any `redcode94` result,
  whether its `None` came from an explicit current-writer `null` or a
  genuinely absent historical key). See the compatibility matrix below for
  the full artifact/version/runtime table.
- **`ruleset_id` is a first-class input to `match_id`'s hash payload**
  (`match_service.canonical_match_id`), sibling to `reproducibility`/
  `entrants`, never folded into `reproducibility` (see
  [RULES.md](RULES.md)'s "Configuration values are not Ruleset identity").
  `result_id`/`replay_id` inherit this transitively, since both already
  embed `match_id`. At v0.10 Phase 4 this was a **deliberate, one-time native-ID
  transition**: because exactly one Ruleset existed at that time, hashing its
  literal value in changes the `match_id`/`result_id`/`replay_id` a v0.10
  Phase 4+ build computes relative to a pre-Phase-4 build, for
  byte-identical execution inputs. Historical stored IDs are never
  rewritten; only fresh computation changes. The direct consequence: a
  `tournament.json`/`evaluation.json` left mid-run by a pre-Phase-4 build
  will show its already-completed matches/cells as
  `resumed_result_mismatch`/`corrupted` on the first Phase-4+ resume — the
  existing, safe, fail-closed behavior any other `match_id` mismatch
  already produces (never silently trusted, never a crash), requiring
  `--retry-failed` or a fresh run. This mirrors the precedent already set
  when `bytefray.evaluation` moved v1 → v2's strictly richer identity
  payload. See [RESULT_SCHEMA.md](RESULT_SCHEMA.md#identity-recipe) for
  the full rationale and pinned tests.
- These four states deliberately reuse a self-contained
  `battle_engine.rules.RulesetProvenance`/`RulesetConfidence` vocabulary
  rather than importing `evaluation_history`'s richer `FieldConfidence`/
  `ConfidenceValue` machinery, which depends on `battle_engine.
  agent_evaluation` and sits well above `battle_engine.rules` in the
  dependency direction. Do not collapse the two vocabularies into one.
- Cross-artifact consistency: a resumed tournament match or evaluation
  cell whose recorded `result.json` `ruleset_id` disagrees with its own
  replay header's `ruleset_id` is treated exactly like an existing
  `match_id`/`result_id` disagreement — demoted to `corrupted`, never
  silently trusted
  (`tournament_service._resumed_result_mismatch`/`agent_evaluation.
  _resumed_cell_mismatch`). The same check is part of `evaluations
  show/compare --verify`'s deep verification
  (`evaluation_history.verification.verify_cell`).
- `battle2.tournament` intentionally does **not** gain a `ruleset_id`
  field: every tournament match already references its own canonical
  `result.json`/`replay.jsonl`, tournament divisions are already
  homogeneous (all-VM or all-Python), and an echoed field would be purely
  redundant informational data with a compatibility-documentation cost and
  no concrete benefit. Tournament-level Ruleset compatibility is derived
  from constituent match artifacts, not stored separately.
- `bytefray.agent_trace` and agent revision manifests
  (`battle_engine.agent_revisions`) are unchanged. A trace records the
  Agent API boundary, not gameplay outcome, and revision identity answers
  "what exact source tree" independently of "under what game rules it
  ran" — see [RULES.md](RULES.md) and `docs/specs/agent_revision.md`.

## Legacy compatibility matrix

| Artifact | Version/era | Rules identity behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `result.json` | current native (VM or Python) | exact recorded Ruleset identity (`bytefray-rules-1`, `bytefray-rules-2`, `bytefray-rules-4-alpha1`, `bytefray-rules-4-alpha2`, or `bytefray-rules-4`) |
| `result.json` | legacy native, `battle2.result` v1, missing field | `recovered` `bytefray-rules-1` (proven stable since v0.3.0) |
| `result.json` | `redcode94`/pMARS | `not_applicable` |
| `replay.jsonl` header | current Ruleset-v1/v2 native, schema v3 | exact recorded Ruleset identity |
| `replay.jsonl` header | current Ruleset-v4 native, schema v4 | recorded `bytefray-rules-4-alpha1`, `bytefray-rules-4-alpha2`, or (as of `v4.0.0-rc1` Phase 2) `bytefray-rules-4`; process state required in production output |
| `replay.jsonl` header | legacy schema v3, missing field | `recovered` `bytefray-rules-1` (v3 never existed before v0.3.0) |
| `replay.jsonl` header | genuine schema v2 (v0.2.0-era canonical, or adapted v0.1) | `unknown` (predates the proven-stable window) |
| `evaluation.json` | current | exact recorded `rules_compatibility_id`; treated as canonical |
| `evaluation.json` | historical v2-v4, `rules_compatibility_id: "evaluation-rules-1"` | recorded verbatim; **normalized** to `bytefray-rules-1` for comparison alignment only |
| `evaluation.json` | v1 (no `rules_compatibility_id` field at all) | `unknown` (never recoverable — v1 never persisted this identifier) |
| `tournament.json` | any | no field; derive from each constituent match's own `result.json`/`replay.jsonl` |

## Experimental/unsupported boundaries

The following are explicitly **not** part of the 1.x stability promise,
regardless of how mature adjacent functionality is:

- **Mixed VM/Python matches** — rejected outright; not implemented.
- **Security sandboxing of Python agent code** — the Agent Lab
  worker-subprocess timeout (`docs/AGENT_LAB.md`) is development-time hang
  **containment**, not a security sandbox; agent code runs with the same
  OS privileges as its host process.
- **Hard callback containment on every execution path** — only
  `bytefray agents test`/`agents validate` run supervised by default;
  `bytefray run`/`tournament` still run Python entrants in-process with no
  hard timeout.
- **Replication / corruptible Python-core designs** — research-stage
  ideas tracked in [FUTURE_PLANS.md](FUTURE_PLANS.md), not implemented.
- **Redcode/pMARS authoring, evaluation, and gameplay parity with the
  native engine** — pMARS interoperability continues, but does not use
  a Bytefray Ruleset, Agent API, or the canonical replay schema; see
  [RULES.md](RULES.md)'s "Redcode/pMARS — not Ruleset v1".
- **Arena translation/placement robustness in evaluation** — decided in
  v0.10 Phase 3: the standard 1.0 `agents evaluate` methodology uses a
  single, fixed arena alignment for every cell (`arena_alignment_mode:
  "fixed"`) and explicitly discloses that translation robustness is not
  evaluated. This is a deliberate, evidence-informed deferral, not an
  oversight — Python arena translation cannot be implemented without
  either an incompatible Agent API v1 change (out of bounds) or
  substantial new shared Python-runtime engineering that is its own,
  separately scoped future effort; VM/native placement is directly usable
  today via `MatchEntrant.start` but `agents evaluate` is Python-only and
  has no VM path to attach it to. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` and
  `docs/RULES.md`.
- **Future rulesets beyond the registered v1/v2/v4-alpha1 identities** —
  additional mechanics require another distinct Ruleset identity, tracked in
  [FUTURE_PLANS.md](FUTURE_PLANS.md), and is explicitly not part of
  Ruleset v1.
