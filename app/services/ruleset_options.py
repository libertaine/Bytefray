# V5 Alpha 1 Phase 1: the Designer's canonical new-session/fresh-state
# Ruleset selection. Before any agent is known (a freshly constructed
# Simple/Advanced/Development combo, before ``setAgents``/a real selection
# ever runs), ``populate_ruleset_combo`` selects this identity rather than
# leaving Qt's incidental "item 0" default -- which, since ``RULESET_V2_
# OPTION`` is listed first in every option tuple below for unrelated
# compatibility-ordering reasons (see ``DESIGNER_RULESET_OPTIONS``'s own
# docstring), silently made an Agent API v1 ruleset look like the
# recommended V5 experience. ``bytefray-rules-4`` is the permanent stable
# process-agent identity and, per docs/research/v5/
# V5_ALPHA1_CONSOLIDATION_AND_PLAN.md's "default cleanly to stable V4" and
# docs/research/v5/V5_ALPHA1_MAINTENANCE_PHASE4_RELEASE_SURFACE_AUDIT.md's
# "V5 ordinary API-v2 default", is the already-documented canonical V5
# default -- this only wires the Designer up to actually start there. This
# only changes the *pre-agent-selection* default: once a real agent or
# roster is known, ``sync_ruleset_choices_for_metadata`` (Development,
# Evaluation) or Simple/Advanced's own Ruleset-first filtering takes over
# exactly as before, using the same unchanged product-preference order.

# Agent API v2 slot, replacing alpha2 there exactly as alpha2 replaced
# alpha1 before it -- Simple's whole promise is "the gameplay you get if
# you do not think about it", and that gameplay is now the permanent
# contract, not a prerelease preview. Neither alpha is removed from the
# product, just from the surface that must never require a user to

# geometry -- see docs/research/v4/V4_RC1_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md)

# methodology would have produced an artifact labelled alpha2 that actually

# "The same Agent API v1 Python agent source may execute under more than
# one compatible Ruleset"), it is merely not the current gameplay. What is
# genuinely exclusive is the other direction: only v1 executes VM/blob
# entrants. Deliberately says nothing about Redcode/pMARS, which uses no
# Bytefray Ruleset at all (docs/RULES.md's "Redcode/pMARS -- not Ruleset
# v1") and must never be implied to be a Ruleset-v1 format.
