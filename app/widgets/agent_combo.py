"""Shared runtime-labeled agent combo-box behavior for match selectors.

Both the Simple and Advanced tabs show each agent's runtime kind next to
its name (``claimer [Python]``, ``runner [VM]``) and disable Agent B
choices whose runtime kind is incompatible with the selected Agent A --
the UX correction that surfaces the existing mixed-VM/Python-execution
restriction *before* a user attempts an invalid match, instead of only
after ``validate_homogeneous`` rejects it. This module is the one shared
implementation both tabs call, so the two selectors cannot drift apart.

The combo's ``DisplayRole`` is always the decorated label; the real,
undecorated discovery identifier (``AgentRow.agent_id``, with a
``row.name`` fallback for legacy rows) is stored under
``Qt.UserRole`` and must always be read back from there via
``selected_agent_name`` -- never recovered by stripping the visible
``[Python]``/``[VM]`` suffix back off the display text.
