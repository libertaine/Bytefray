"""v3.0.0-alpha2: runtime-kind disclosure in ``bytefray agents`` listing.

The Agent Designer's match selectors have decorated every entry with its
runtime kind since RC2 (``claimer [Python]``, ``runner [VM]``), so a user
learns before attempting a match that VM entrants cannot run under Ruleset
v2. The CLI listing showed no such distinction, which mattered more once
the bundled starter set mixed five Python agents with four VM ones. These
tests pin the disclosure and the vocabulary shared with the GUI.

Presentation only: the listing has no JSON/machine-readable form, and no
persisted artifact schema carries a runtime label, so nothing here
constrains a serialized contract.
