"""Phase 8: deterministic Fight Night presentation plans.

Like the Phase 7 Director tests, every assertion here is checked against a
real ``NativeMatchService`` run's replay/trace pair. The disclosure tests in
particular always prove their precondition from the artifacts first (for
example, that a given entrant is delivered zero events for the whole match)
before asserting anything about what the ribbon shows, so a passing test is
evidence about a real execution rather than about a convenient fixture.
