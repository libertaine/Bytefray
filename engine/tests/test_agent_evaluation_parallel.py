"""v1.6 Phase 2 -- deterministic parallel evaluation (docs/V1_6_PHASE2_
PARALLEL_EVALUATION.md).

Covers the governing spec's required regression matrix: serial-vs-parallel
and worker-count equivalence, repeatability, completion-order reversal,
worker-crash handling, source-drift stop-dispatch under concurrency,
evaluation_id independence from worker count, and ``--workers`` CLI
plumbing. Uses real worker subprocesses throughout (not mocked) -- these
tests are slower than the rest of the suite but exercise the actual
subprocess protocol, not a stand-in for it.
