"""v4 alpha2 qualification: round-robin intra-entrant process selection.

Covers the scheduler half of the alpha2 Ruleset delta
(``docs/V4_ALPHA2_DESIGN.md``). Two layers:

* direct unit coverage of ``ProcessMatchController._select_active_process``,
  which is where the whole semantic lives -- initial cursor, advancement,
  disruption, quota exhaustion, redistribution, and the deliberate absence of
  a tick reset -- driven slot by slot so each documented clause is asserted
  on its own rather than inferred from a match outcome;
* end-to-end match coverage proving the entrant-level K=2 scheduler, the
  quota allocator, and alpha1's own frozen selection are all untouched.

**V6 Phase 2B.10 Scope B note.** ``ProcessMatchController`` accepts a
``RulesetPolicy`` object directly, via the ``ruleset_policy=`` keyword
every ``_controller()`` call below uses, and never consults the
executable registry (``resolve_ruleset_policy``) to get one. That makes
this file's tests genuinely independent of alpha1/alpha2's
executable-registration status, which V6 Phase 2B.10 Scope B retired
(docs/research/v6/V6_PHASE2B10_SCOPE_B_V4_ALPHA_RETIREMENT.md). What did
change is that the named ``RULESET_V4_ALPHA1``/``RULESET_V4_ALPHA2``
objects were removed from ``ruleset_policy.py`` entirely (not merely
deregistered), so they can no longer be imported; this file reconstructs
their exact frozen field values locally instead (see
``_FROZEN_ALPHA1_POLICY``/``_FROZEN_ALPHA2_POLICY``, traceable to
``ruleset_policy.py``'s own retirement comment, which documents the same
values), keeping every assertion below just as meaningful as before
retirement.
