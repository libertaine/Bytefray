"""v3 Phase 6: focused tests for the cross-tick active-defense episode
detector (``tools/v3_phase6_defense_episode.py``).

These are hermetic unit tests against synthetic ``TickSnapshot`` sequences,
not real match executions -- the broader empirical validation against the
committed Phase 1 corpus (selectivity, budget robustness, replay
auditability) lives in the module's own ``qualify``/``determinism`` CLI
commands and is reported in
``docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE6_ACTIVE_DEFENSIVE_INTERVENTION_QUALIFICATION.md``, which this
module does not duplicate. Each test builds the smallest tick sequence that
isolates one mechanic from the governing Phase 6O checklist.
