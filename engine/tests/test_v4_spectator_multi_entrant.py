"""Phase 8A: Director behaviour on real 3- and 4-entrant matches.

Phase 7 qualified the Director against a two-entrant corpus only and recorded
that gap as its own limitation (Phase 7 research document Sec. 23 item 3).
This module closes it with real multi-entrant matches -- every assertion below
is checked against a genuine ``NativeMatchService`` run's replay/trace pair,
never a hand-built event list, so a claim about "what the Director does when
two entrants fight and a third is blind" is a claim about an execution that
actually happened.

The two questions Phase 8's brief asks by name (Sec. 7/8) are both answered
here as executable assertions rather than only in prose: whether Broadcast
becomes permanently slow when *someone* is always fighting, and whether
several unrelated simultaneous engagements defeat the sustained-activity
fatigue rule.
