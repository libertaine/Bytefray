    Both the native VM's ``Agent`` and the Python runtime's

    resolution only ever needs to know who is still alive and how to name
    them, so it should not be coupled to either concrete state class.

    ``agent_id`` is declared read-only (a property, not a plain attribute)
    because both concrete state classes expose it as a compatibility
    property backed by their stored ``EntrantIdentity`` -- see
    ``docs/archive/v1/V1_5_PHASE5_ENTRANT_IDENTITY_EXECUTION_STATE.md``. A plain
    ``agent_id: str`` attribute declaration here would reject that read-only
    property under structural typing even though the runtime value is
    identical.

    This is the one authoritative winner-resolution implementation shared

    than an empty string) should apply ``WINNER_TIE_SENTINEL`` themselves;
    keeping that mapping out of this function lets it stay agnostic of
    presentation concerns.

    Survivor eligibility (v2.0.0-alpha.4.1): a dead entrant can never win
    while at least one entrant is still alive, regardless of accumulated
    score -- the direct N-entrant generalization of the pre-existing
    1v1/single-survivor rule below, not a new rule. With exactly one
    entrant alive, that entrant wins outright (unchanged). With two or
    more alive, ``score_fallback`` compares only the alive entrants --
    dead entrants keep their historical score (nothing here mutates
    ``score``) but are excluded from winner eligibility. With zero alive,
    there is no survivor to prefer, so comparison falls back to every
    entrant, dead or alive, exactly as it always has -- see
    ``docs/archive/v2/V2_0_ALPHA4_1_WINNER_SEMANTICS.md`` for why the zero-survivor
    case is deliberately not given its own special rule.
