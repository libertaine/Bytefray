# The first four are native VM starters (manifest-only; resolved against
# the built-in VM programs in battle_engine.builtins by name -- see
# cli.py's SUPPORTED fallback). The remaining seven are Agent API v1 Python
# starters, each shipping its own agent.py implementing a distinct strategy
# against the restricted Python Agent API rather than native VM bytecode --
# see each agent.py's module docstring for its strategy and the reasoning
# behind it. ensure_starter_agents() treats both kinds identically:
# non-destructive copy-if-missing into the same writable agents/ catalog.
#
# Five of the Python starters (claimer, strider, hunter, wanderer,
# adaptive, added in v0.6.1) are expansion-family strategies and are also
# pinned members of the frozen v2 benchmark population -- their source is
# content-addressed in battle_engine/data/benchmarks/v2_baseline.json and
# must never be edited (see docs/V3_PHASE0_RESEARCH_BASELINE.md Sec 3).
# raider and sentinel (added in v3.0.0-alpha2) are deliberately NOT
# benchmark members: they exist to demonstrate the Ruleset-v2 vulnerable-
# core mechanic itself -- attacking a core and defending one -- which no
# expansion starter exercises, and they stay freely maintainable precisely
# because they carry no benchmark identity.
#
# The four v5_* starters (added in v5.0.0a1, V5 Alpha 1 Phase C -- see
# docs/research/v5/V5_ALPHA1_PHASE_C_STARTER_AGENTS.md) are the Agent API
# v2 educational ladder: regional offense, search-and-strike movement,
# READ-driven core defense, and a two-process team. They are ADDITIVE. The
# six v4_* entries above them keep their historical behavior byte for byte
# -- replays, evaluation records and the Phase 0/R3/R4 research corpora all
# refer to those IDs, so a v5_* redesign gets a new ID rather than silently
# replacing an old one.
