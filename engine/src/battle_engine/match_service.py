    "normal match path" (``bytefray run``/tournament) never sets either

    exact unmodified v0.4.0

    compositions honor either field; a VM match request that happens to
    set them is a no-op, since VM matches have no Python Agent API
    boundary to trace or supervise.

    ``ruleset_id`` is v2.0.0-alpha.1's one additive selector (see

    identity and the replay/result ``ruleset_id`` fields by
