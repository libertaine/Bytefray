"""``bytefray agents evaluate <candidate-id>`` — a deterministic evaluation matrix.

Runs a candidate agent (and, optionally, a baseline agent for comparison)
against an explicit, author-chosen opponent/seed matrix, reusing
``agent_test.test_agent`` as the exact per-cell executor so every
evaluation cell is byte-for-byte reproducible via a plain ``bytefray
agents test`` invocation. Produces an additive, independently versioned
``bytefray.evaluation`` v1 artifact that references (never duplicates) the
canonical ``replay.jsonl``/``result.json`` each cell's real match already
writes. See ``docs/specs/agent_evaluation.md`` for the full design
rationale.

This module is Qt-free and headless: it executes agent code only via
``agent_test.test_agent`` (the same production execution boundary
``agents test`` itself uses), never independently.

# versioned explicitly per AGENTS.md rather than silently changing what a
# reader can expect to find, even though it does NOT change evaluation_id's
# hash payload (see IDENTITY_VERSION below, deliberately left unchanged).
# A v2 evaluation.json is not resumable under this schema_version (Sec 5.3
# of the spec -- the same "old artifact needs a fresh evaluation" pattern
# v1 -> v2 already established); it remains fully readable via

# versioned explicitly per AGENTS.md rather than silently changing
# evaluation_id's wire meaning in place. agent_revision_id (above) is
# deliberately NOT folded into this hash -- see

# never collide); the evaluation level gains "orientation_mode" and
# "arena_alignment_mode" (both enter _evaluation_id's payload and are
# persisted as top-level sibling fields, following the exact

    (docs/specs/agent_evaluation.md Sec 14).

    ``canonical_match_id`` reads ``spec.source_path`` from disk at call
    time (see ``match_service.canonical_match_id``), so this helper is only
    safe to use against *live, freshly re-resolved* specs (resume, where

    silently observe the same (already-drifted) content the executor itself
    just read, making the comparison pass despite drift. See
    ``_post_execution_identity_drift`` for that check instead.

    (``match_service.canonical_match_id``). ``_test_agent`` always
    constructs its entrants tuple as ``(TESTED_AGENT_SLOT-entrant,
    OPPONENT_SLOT-entrant)`` positionally -- slot A's entrant always comes
    first in the tuple, slot B's always second, regardless of which logical
    role (subject/opponent) occupies which slot. This helper must build the
    identical positional order (always ``TESTED_AGENT_SLOT`` first,
    ``OPPONENT_SLOT`` second), with only *which agent* fills each slot
    varying by orientation -- not a "subject first, opponent second" order,
    which silently recomputes a different id than a real ``opponent_first``
    execution actually produced. Previously this caught every
    already-completed ``opponent_first`` cell in a false
    ``resumed_result_mismatch`` on every subsequent resume, even when

    Orientation-aware (Phase 5 spec Sec H.1): resolves which physical slot
    each role actually executed in via ``physical_slots_for_orientation``,
    rather than assuming subject=A/opponent=B -- for an ``opponent_first``
    cell the subject really executed in slot B and the opponent in slot A,
    and checking the wrong slot would silently compare each side's frozen
    identity against the other side's executed metadata.

    ``NativeAgentResult.metadata`` for a Python entrant is populated by
    ``python_runtime.PythonEntrantController``/``match_service.
    _build_python_result`` from the exact source the executor just loaded
    and ran -- it is not a second independent disk read performed by this
    module after the fact. Comparing it against ``planned_identities``
    (frozen once at preflight, before any cell executed) is therefore the
    strongest available check that the identity actually used for
    acceptance corresponds to what the executor actually loaded (Sec 7
    finding), and -- unlike recomputing ``canonical_match_id`` from a live
    ``AgentSpec.source_path`` after execution -- cannot be silently
    defeated by a source edit that is already in place by the time this
    check runs.

    The required invariant (v0.7 closure pass, lazy-import fix) is now
    three-way, not two-way::

        initial executor fingerprint == frozen planned fingerprint == final executor fingerprint

    i.e. both ``local_source_fingerprint`` (captured at load time, before
    ``reset()``/``act()`` ever run) *and* ``local_source_fingerprint_final``
    (captured after the match finishes, so every lazy import a running
    agent performed has already happened) must each independently equal
    the frozen plan's single recorded value. A local helper imported
    lazily from inside ``reset()``/``act()`` -- rather than at module load
    time -- can change between those two executor-recorded readings; the
    load-time fingerprint alone cannot see that, since the lazy import
    that actually reads the changed file has not happened yet when it is
    captured.

    A residual TOCTOU remains and is documented rather than hidden: inside
    ``python_runtime.PythonEntrantController.__init__`` (and its supervised
    counterpart), the agent module is loaded/executed first and its
    ``source_sha256``/``local_source_fingerprint`` are each computed by a
    *separate* subsequent read (see ``PythonEntrantState.source_digest``/
    ``PythonEntrantState.local_source_fingerprint``); symmetrically, the
    final fingerprint is computed once, in a separate step, after the tick
    loop's last actual local-file read. An edit that lands and is then
    reverted before the nearest such read captures it -- at either end --
    is not detectable from outside that call. This module neither
    introduces nor can close that inner window; it only guarantees that
    whatever the executor itself recorded as having run, at both points,
    is cross-checked against the frozen plan.
