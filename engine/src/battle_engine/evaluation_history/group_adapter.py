"""Bridges evaluation-history's ``AdaptedCell`` to Phase 3 group-analysis
refs (``docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE3_MULTI_ENTRANT_ANALYSIS.md``).

Deliberately a separate module from ``models.py``/``cli.py``, mirroring
``behavior_adapter.py``'s identical precedent exactly: it is the one place
``evaluation_history`` composes its own path-containment discipline
(``resolve_contained_path``) with
``battle_engine.evaluation_group_analysis``'s cell-detail read, so
containment checking is never silently skipped for a historical (on-disk,
potentially hand-edited) artifact the way it is legitimately skipped for
the live-run path (``agent_evaluation.py`` already trusts a directory it
just created).

Never called by ``discovery.py``/``adapt_v1``/``adapt_v2`` -- like Phase 5's
``behavior``/Beta2 Phase 1's ``capture``, group analysis performs real I/O
(one ``result.json`` read per scored group cell), so it must stay opt-in
and never run merely because an evaluation was discovered/listed.
