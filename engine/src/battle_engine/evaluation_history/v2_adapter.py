# v3 (docs/specs/agent_revision.md Sec 5.3) added one additive top-level
# "agent_revisions" sibling field to "planned_identities" and otherwise
# changed nothing about the v2 wire shape this adapter reads -- accepting
# it here is a narrow compatibility fix (nothing below reads or exposes
# "agent_revisions" yet; that is deferred, along with any other revision-
# aware evaluation_history/CLI work, to a later phase), not a scope
# expansion: without this, every fresh v3 evaluation would be reported
# HealthCode.UNSUPPORTED_VERSION by `list`/`show`/`compare`, a regression
# in the already-shipped v0.7 evaluation_history feature that a "Phase 3
# has no history changes" reading of the plan did not anticipate.
#
# v4 (v0.9 Phase 6, Phase 5 spec Sec J.1/AA.4.8) added per-cell
# "orientation"/"orientation_index" and evaluation-wide "orientation_mode"/
# "arena_alignment_mode" -- also additive over v3's wire shape, so it joins
# this same adapter rather than a new module, following the identical
# precedent this comment already documents for v2->v3. Field extraction
# below is version-conditional: schema_version 4 reads the new fields as
# RECORDED; schema_version 2/3 (which never had this concept) recover them
# as certain historical facts (Sec L.2/AA.4.6), never UNKNOWN.
#
# v5 (v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 1, docs/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md)
# added per-cell "placement_id"/"subject_start"/"opponent_start"/
# "placement_index"/"rules_compatibility_id" -- also additive, joining this
# same adapter for the identical reason as v4 above. Only ever actually
# written by a Ruleset-v2-methodology evaluation (rules_compatibility_id
# resolves to "bytefray-rules-2"); a v1-methodology evaluation keeps
# writing SCHEMA_VERSION (4), never SCHEMA_VERSION_V2 (5), so schema
# version alone already distinguishes "this artifact's placement is
# meaningful" from "this artifact never varied placement."
#
# v6 (v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 2, docs/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE2_MULTI_ENTRANT_EVALUATION.md)
# added per-cell "roster_agent_ids"/"seat_agent_ids"/"layout_id"/
# "seat_starts"/"seat_assignment_index"/"layout_index" and evaluation-wide
# "group"/"roster_agent_ids" -- also additive, joining this same adapter
# for the identical reason as v4/v5 above. Only ever actually written by a
# multi-entrant ("group") evaluation; a 1v1 v2 evaluation keeps writing
# SCHEMA_VERSION_V2 (5), never SCHEMA_VERSION_V2_GROUP (6).
# v7 (v4.0.0-rc1 Phase 1, docs/research/v4/V4_PRE_RC_GAMEPLAY_EVALUATION_RESEARCH.md
# Sec H) added the stable v4 seeded-placement evaluation methodology.
# Wire-shape-additive over v6 exactly like v3/v4/v5/v6 before it -- no new
# per-cell field is introduced (a v4-seeded cell reuses "placement_id"/
# "subject_start"/"opponent_start", the same three fields v5 introduced;
# only their *meaning* changes, from "which of 3 standard placements" to
# "which seed-derived sample" -- see AdaptedCell.placement's own docstring),
# so it joins this same adapter and the same orientation/placement-aware
# version tuples below rather than a new module or new tuples. Never
# group-aware: v4-seeded group evaluation is out of Phase 1 scope, and
# `EvaluationService._validate` rejects the combination outright.
