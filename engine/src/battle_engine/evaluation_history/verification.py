    Checks (as appropriate/available): nested result exists and is

    replay filename tries to escape the cell's own artifact directory is
    refused rather than followed; replay exists, its digest matches, and
    its own header is internally consistent with the result envelope
    (H1); the result's ``result_id``, ``match_id``, seed, and entrant order
    match the evaluation cell's own recorded values; the canonical result's
    winner is consistent with the cell's recorded outcome; and, when the
    subject's (candidate/baseline) or opponent's identity was actually
    ``RECORDED`` (v2 only -- v1 identity is always ``UNKNOWN`` and is never
    silently treated as matching), that identity matches the result's own
    per-entrant metadata (H1: now including ``entry_point``/
    ``local_source_fingerprint``, not just source_sha256/api_version/
    agent_version); and, when ``expected_placement`` is given (a v4-seeded
    cell only -- see ``verify_summary``), that the cell's own recorded
    ``subject_start``/``opponent_start`` reconstruct exactly from its seed
    via the production placement seam (research report Sec H.1 item 7).

    H1 (Beta2 Phase 4.1): a group (multi-entrant, N>=3, ``cell.seat_agent_
    ids`` non-empty) cell is verified through the identical checks above,
    generalized rather than skipped -- expected physical entrant order
    becomes ``seat_label(0..N-1)`` (never the fixed pairwise ``(A, B)``),
    and the subject's physical seat is looked up from the cell's own
    recorded seat assignment (mirroring ``EvaluationCell.subject_seat``'s
    first-occurrence convention for self-play) rather than from an
    orientation axis a group cell never has. There is no single well-
    defined "opponent slot" for N>=3, so the opponent-identity cross-check
    is skipped for a group cell -- its ``opponent_identity`` is always
    ``UNKNOWN`` regardless (see ``v2_adapter.py``'s own H2 fix), so this
    changes no outcome, only makes the group case explicit.

    ``subject_identity`` is the candidate/baseline identity ``ConfidenceValue``
    from the owning summary appropriate to ``cell.subject_role`` -- passed
    in by :func:`verify_summary` rather than looked up here, since a single
    cell has no reference back to its owning summary. ``None`` is treated
    the same as ``ConfidenceValue.unknown()`` (candidate check skipped).

    Cells that never claim a real, scored outcome (pending/failed/
    corrupted/drift-detected) are ``eligible=False`` -- skipped, never
