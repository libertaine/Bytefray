"""Bridges evaluation-history's ``AdaptedCell`` to Phase 5 behavior refs
(``docs/archive/v1/V1_6_PHASE5_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS.md``).

Deliberately a separate module from ``models.py``/``cli.py``: it is the one
place ``evaluation_history`` composes its own path-containment discipline
(``resolve_contained_path``, the same M4 rule ``verification.verify_cell``
already applies to a cell's nested ``result.json``) with
``battle_engine.evaluation_behavior``'s cell-detail read, so containment
checking is never silently skipped for a historical (on-disk, potentially
hand-edited) artifact the way it is legitimately skipped for the live-run
path (``agent_evaluation.py`` already trusts a directory it just created).

Never called by ``discovery.py``/``adapt_v1``/``adapt_v2`` -- unlike Phase
4's ``analysis`` (pure, free), behavior computation performs real I/O (one
``result.json`` read per scored cell), so it must stay opt-in and never
run merely because an evaluation was discovered/listed (Sec 10/24 of the
design doc).
