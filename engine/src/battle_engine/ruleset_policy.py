"""Executable Ruleset policy and fail-closed resolver.

``rules.py`` is the frozen, dependency-free record of Ruleset *identity*
(``BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID`` and its historical-alias/provenance vocabulary),
deliberately kept free of anything executable so it can sit underneath the
runtime, artifact, and evaluation layers without risk of an import cycle
(see its own module docstring). This module is the next layer up: it pairs
that identity with the *executable* Ruleset semantics that, as of v1.5
Phase 4, have a single shared implementation -- entrant scheduling (all
Rulesets dispatch through ``battle_engine.scheduler.run_chunked_quota`` via
:meth:`RulesetPolicy.run_scheduler`; sequential-mode Rulesets supply a
``chunk_size`` equal to the entrant quota with no start rotation, which
preserves the original declaration/seat-order sequential-turn behavior that
``run_sequential_quota`` -- still exported, unchanged, and directly tested,
just no longer on this dispatch path -- used to provide directly) and match
termination decision/reason (``RulesetPolicy.resolve_termination``) -- and
provides one fail-closed resolver from a Ruleset ID string to its policy.

This is deliberately a thin seam, not a Ruleset framework. Exactly one
Ruleset exists (Ruleset v1); the resolver exists so runtime construction
has one obvious place to obtain Ruleset-owned scheduling/termination
semantics instead of duplicating them per runtime, and so an unrecognized
Ruleset ID fails before any gameplay executes rather than silently running
as v1. Scoring, statistics, and winner resolution are not yet
Ruleset-policy-owned -- see ``docs/V1_5_PHASE4_TERMINATION_POLICY.md`` for
what remains outside this seam and why.

# v4.0.0-rc1 Phase 2: the permanent stable identity now occupies the

# alpha1 before it (see the superseded comment this one replaces, preserved
# in git history). Every v4 identity accepts exactly the same rosters
# (Python-only, Agent API v2), so a candidate walk that reached an older one
# first would make the newer one unreachable, and one that listed an older
# identity after a newer one would list an entry no roster could ever
# select automatically. The product intent this tuple has always encoded is
# "an omitted Ruleset gets the *current* v4 gameplay contract" -- prerelease
# during alpha1/alpha2, permanent now that a stable identity exists. Neither
# alpha1 nor alpha2 is hidden by this: both stay fully registered in
# ``_RULESET_POLICIES``, explicitly selectable by name from every CLI and
# Designer surface, and are still what every persisted alpha1/alpha2
# artifact resolves to -- see docs/COMPATIBILITY.md's v4 identity section.

# V5 research constraint (pre-Phase-0 baseline remediation). An experimental
# V5 Ruleset must require *explicit* selection: it must not be added to this
# tuple, and must never become what an existing Agent API v2 roster receives
# when the Ruleset is omitted. Stable ``bytefray-rules-4`` is the immutable
# scientific control the V5 program measures against, so silently
# reassigning the omitted-selection slot to an experimental identity would
# contaminate every comparison made against it -- the same class of defect
# as the ``ProcessMatchController`` alpha1 fallback corrected alongside this
# note (see test_v4_runtime_default_ruleset.py). The v4 promotion precedent
# above is not a counter-example: alpha1 -> alpha2 -> stable moved this slot

    This is the RC1 default-Ruleset-defect fix: the seam a user-facing
    caller (``bytefray run``, ``bytefray agents test``, ``bytefray agents
    evaluate``, ``bytefray tournament``) called, with the entrant runtime
    kinds it already knows for *this* request, to turn a caller's omitted
    ``--ruleset`` into the same current-gameplay identity Agent Designer has
    used since v3.0.0-alpha2 (see ``app/services/ruleset_options.py``),
    instead of the historical Ruleset-v1 identity every native execution
    path fell back to before this fix.

    **A runtime kind alone is no longer enough information to resolve a
    Ruleset**, because ``bytefray-rules-2`` and ``bytefray-rules-4-alpha1``
    are both Python-only and are told apart by Agent API version, not
    runtime kind. Every in-tree product entry point therefore now calls
    :func:`resolve_omitted_ruleset_for_agents` with real entrant metadata.
    This function is retained as the kind-only compatibility surface for
    out-of-tree callers, delegating to that same resolver with Python
    projected as Agent API v1 -- the assumption its signature has always
    encoded -- so its documented behavior below is unchanged.

    ``requested_ruleset_id`` is ``None`` for "the caller omitted --ruleset"
    and any other value for "the caller explicitly selected this Ruleset".
    An explicit selection is always returned unchanged -- this function
    never validates, corrects, or overrides one, including a selection that
    a downstream runtime-compatibility check (
    :meth:`RulesetPolicy.unsupported_runtime_kinds`, raised as
    ``RulesetRuntimeUnsupportedError``) will go on to reject as
    incompatible with ``runtime_kinds``. Only an omitted Ruleset is ever
    resolved here.

    ``runtime_kinds`` is the resolved entrant ``kind`` set for this
    specific request (``MatchEntrant.kind`` values: ``"python"``/``"vm"``,
    or an evaluation/tournament roster's equivalent). An omitted Ruleset
    resolves to :data:`BYTEFRAY_RULESET_V2_ID` exactly when every requested
    entrant is Python (a non-empty subset of :data:`_PYTHON_ONLY_KINDS`);
    every other case -- VM-only, mixed Python/VM, or an empty/unknown kind
    set -- resolves to the frozen :data:`~battle_engine.rules.
    BYTEFRAY_RULESET_ID` (Ruleset v1), exactly the historical omitted
    default. A mixed Python/VM roster therefore still resolves to Ruleset
    v1 here (v1 imposes no runtime-kind restriction, so it always executes
    a mixed roster); this function never itself raises for an incompatible
    composition -- that stays ``NativeMatchService``'s job, unchanged, and
    is only reachable from an *explicit* incompatible selection, never from
    an omitted one.

    Callers that construct their own ``MatchRequest``/``EvaluationRequest``/
    ``TournamentRequest`` directly (existing tests, research tools in
    ``tools/``, and any other library caller that never goes through one of
    the product CLIs above) are completely unaffected: none of those types'
    own ``ruleset_id: str | None = None`` defaults change meaning by this
    function existing. Only a CLI entry point that explicitly calls this
    function, and then threads its return value into the request it
    constructs, sees the new omitted-Ruleset behavior -- see each CLI
    module's own ``main()`` for where that happens.
