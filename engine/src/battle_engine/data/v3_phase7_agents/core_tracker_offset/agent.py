"""Core Tracker (Offset) -- a v3 Phase 7 disposable control agent.

**Not a reference agent. Not pinned to any frozen benchmark population.**
This is a byte-for-byte copy of ``reference_agents/core_tracker/agent.py``
(the real, frozen ``v2-baseline`` population member) with exactly one
behavioral line changed, to isolate one causal question raised by
``docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE6_ACTIVE_DEFENSIVE_INTERVENTION_QUALIFICATION.md`` Sec 15/20:

Phase 6 found that at ``instr_per_tick=32``, real Core Tracker's own
``expand_cursor`` starts at exactly its own ``core_start`` with **no
offset** (``self.expand_cursor = observation.pc % self.arena_size``), so
its very first action after a same-tick assault takes its own core back to
"defended" -- a routine territorial claim with zero defensive intent that
this detector's reclaim clause cannot distinguish from a genuine reaction,
inflating Core Tracker's own opportunity-conditioned qualifying rate to
50.0% at that budget and eating into Q6's budget-robustness margin.

The one change below moves ``expand_cursor``'s starting point past this
agent's own core, mirroring ``core_defender/agent.py``'s own precedent
(``expand_cursor = core_start + DEFENDED_RADIUS``) exactly -- "so the
defended cells and the expansion sweep never fight over the same ground,"
in that agent's own words. Nothing else about this agent's search,
probing, assault, or cost profile is touched, so any behavioral difference
measured between this agent and real Core Tracker is attributable to this
one line, not to a bundle of changes.

This agent is disposable research tooling for Phase 7's confound-isolation
experiment (see ``docs/archive/v3/V3_PHASE7_HIGH_BUDGET_CONFOUND_ISOLATION.md`` and
``tools/v3_phase7_confound_isolation.py``), never registered in any
``BenchmarkPopulation`` manifest, never pinned via content-addressed
revision, and never substituted into ``v2_baseline_corpus.json`` or any
other frozen benchmark. It exists only to be swapped into a small, disposable,
separately-executed corpus alongside the real, untouched Core Tracker, so
Phase 7 can compare the two without altering anything Phase 0-6 committed.

Everything below this note, other than the renamed class/factory and the
one ``expand_cursor`` line inside ``act()``, is copied unmodified from
``reference_agents/core_tracker/agent.py`` -- including its own historical
design-rationale docstring, preserved here so a diff against the original
shows exactly one substantive change.

---

Original module docstring (``core_tracker/agent.py``), reproduced verbatim
below for lineage:

Core Tracker -- a v2.0.0-alpha.8 "Vulnerable Core" reference agent.

Experimental/reference only, not a claim of optimal strategy -- see
docs/V2_0_ALPHA8_PLACEMENT_AGNOSTIC_OFFENSE.md for the research question
this agent exists to probe: can an ordinary Agent API v1 entrant locate and
pressure a vulnerable core across substantially different, arbitrary start
placements -- not just the handful of fixed absolute addresses the original
Core Seeker's own schedule happens to pass near -- using only the same
``READ``/``WRITE`` primitives every other agent in this file already uses?

Three states, cycled by a small, traceable state machine (``self.mode``):

    "scan"    -- default. One action in every ``SCAN_EVERY`` is a ``READ``
                 at a slowly advancing scan cursor; the rest are an
                 ordinary outward claiming ``WRITE``.
    "probe"   -- entered the instant a coarse scan ``READ`` returns a
                 foreign-looking byte. Issues a small, fixed set of
                 additional ``READ``s at offsets near that first hit.
    "assault" -- a fixed ``ASSAULT_ACTIONS``-action ``WRITE`` burst across
                 a window centered on the refined estimate from the probe
                 evidence.

See the real ``core_tracker/agent.py`` for the full design rationale
(coarse-to-fine search, echo-lock avoidance, RNG-seeded scan anchor, cost
accounting, and the alpha.11/beta1 self-core filtering revision this
agent's own ``_looks_foreign`` also carries forward unchanged).
