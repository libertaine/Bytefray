# v2.0.0-alpha.1 "Vulnerable Core" (docs/V2_0_ALPHA_ARCHITECTURE.md Sec 6,
# docs/V2_0_ALPHA1_EVALUATION.md): each Python entrant's core is a
# fixed-size window of ``CORE_SIZE`` bytes anchored at its own original
# spawn address (``entrant.start % arena_size``), using ordinary
# ``pos % arena_size`` wrap -- the same addressing every other arena access
# in this engine already uses (``vm.py``'s ``_rd32``/``_wr8``). Deliberately
# NOT derived from the entrant's program size, write count, or any other
# entrant-controlled property (that would reward padding/footprint
# inflation with survivability -- see the governing task's Phase 3).
#
# 8 was chosen, not computed: Python entrants load no code into the arena
# at all (unlike the VM path, which has a real per-entrant code footprint
# to reason about -- see ``VM.load_code``), so there is no existing
# "footprint" to size a core against in the first place. Against the
# default ``Config.arena_size == 4096``, 8 cells is small enough (0.2% of
# the arena) that a core is a genuine localized target an opponent must
# actually find and fully overwrite -- not a proxy for general territorial
# dominance -- while still being more than one cell, so a single incidental
# write passing through can't trivially end a match by accident. It is a
# fixed module constant, not threaded through ``Config``, per the governing
# task's instruction not to make it configurable for this alpha.
CORE_SIZE = 8

# v2.0.0-alpha.11 "Consistent Core Observability"
# (docs/V2_0_ALPHA11_RULESET_V2_CANDIDATE_RESOLUTION.md).
#
# The defect this closes, stated precisely: under
# ``bytefray-rules-2-alpha1``, ``seed_core_ownership`` establishes a core's
# initial ownership by writing the byte value ``0`` -- which is exactly what
# untouched arena already contains (docs/RULES.md: "The arena starts filled
# with byte 0"). Ownership is engine-internal and unreadable by any entrant,
# so *content* is the only channel through which a core can be observed at
# all. The consequence, measured across alpha.10's 976-match corpus: an
# entrant that never writes into its own core is literally invisible to
# every non-privileged searcher (0% capture rate against ``claimer``/
# ``hunter``), while an entrant that *defends* its core becomes detectable
# precisely because it defended (12-28% capture rate against the two
# defenders). Defending was informationally self-punishing and blind
# expansion bought invisibility for free.
#
# ``CORE_BEACON_BYTE`` is the public, fixed constant a core's own cells hold
# instead. It is Ruleset knowledge on exactly the same footing as
# ``CORE_SIZE`` already is (``core_defender``/``reactive_core_defender``/
# ``core_tracker`` all already hardcode ``8`` on that basis) -- not
# privileged information about any specific opponent, and deliberately not
# keyed to any reference agent: no agent needs to recognize this particular
# value to benefit, since every existing content-based searcher keys on
# "non-zero and not my own signature", which any non-zero beacon satisfies.
#
# ``0xCE`` was chosen, not computed: it must be non-zero (a zero beacon is
# the defect itself) and must differ from every signature byte used by any
# bundled starter or reference agent -- ``0x99`` (adaptive), ``0xC1``
# (claimer), ``0xE3`` (hunter), ``0xC2`` (strider), ``0x2C`` (wanderer),
# ``0xD3`` (core_defender), ``0x5E`` (core_seeker), ``0xA5`` (core_tracker),
# ``0xC7`` (reactive_core_defender) -- so that no agent is accidentally
# blinded to beacons by its own ``value != self.signature`` self-filter and
# no agent's ordinary territory is mistaken for a core.
CORE_BEACON_BYTE = 0xCE

# The historical alpha.1 seeding content: ownership without an observable
# footprint. Retained explicitly (rather than as a bare literal) so the
# alpha.1-vs-alpha.11 difference is a named, greppable Ruleset property.

    Three properties this rule is carefully scoped to preserve, each of which

    * **Observability does not equal invulnerability.** Only cells the owner

      never a non-zero byte, so ``core_defender``'s ``0xD3`` and
      ``reactive_core_defender``'s ``0xC7`` core signatures survive intact

    * **The owner cannot hide.** Writing ``0`` over its own core is the only
      way an entrant could restore alpha.1's invisibility while keeping
      ownership, and that is precisely what this repairs.
