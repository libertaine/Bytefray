# v2.0.0-alpha.1 "Vulnerable Core" (docs/V2_0_ALPHA_ARCHITECTURE.md Sec 6,
# docs/V2_0_ALPHA1_EVALUATION.md): each Python entrant's core is a
# fixed-size window of ``CORE_SIZE`` bytes anchored at its own original
# spawn address (``entrant.start % arena_size``), using ordinary
# ``pos % arena_size`` wrap -- the same addressing every other arena access
# in this engine already uses (``vm.py``'s ``_rd32``/``_wr8``). Deliberately
# NOT derived from the entrant's program size, write count, or any other
# entrant-controlled property (that would reward padding/footprint
# inflation with survivability -- see the governing task's Phase 3).
#
# 8 was chosen, not computed: Python entrants load no code into the arena
# at all (unlike the VM path, which has a real per-entrant code footprint
# to reason about -- see ``VM.load_code``), so there is no existing
# "footprint" to size a core against in the first place. Against the
# default ``Config.arena_size == 4096``, 8 cells is small enough (0.2% of
# the arena) that a core is a genuine localized target an opponent must
# actually find and fully overwrite -- not a proxy for general territorial
# dominance -- while still being more than one cell, so a single incidental
# write passing through can't trivially end a match by accident. It is a
# fixed module constant, not threaded through ``Config``, per the governing
# task's instruction not to make it configurable for this alpha.
CORE_SIZE = 8

# v2.0.0-alpha.11 "Consistent Core Observability"
# (docs/V2_0_ALPHA11_RULESET_V2_CANDIDATE_RESOLUTION.md).
#
# The defect this closes, stated precisely: under
# ``bytefray-rules-2-alpha1``, ``seed_core_ownership`` establishes a core's
# initial ownership by writing the byte value ``0`` -- which is exactly what
# untouched arena already contains (docs/RULES.md: "The arena starts filled
# with byte 0"). Ownership is engine-internal and unreadable by any entrant,
# so *content* is the only channel through which a core can be observed at
# all. The consequence, measured across alpha.10's 976-match corpus: an
# entrant that never writes into its own core is literally invisible to
# every non-privileged searcher (0% capture rate against ``claimer``/
# ``hunter``), while an entrant that *defends* its core becomes detectable
# precisely because it defended (12-28% capture rate against the two
# defenders). Defending was informationally self-punishing and blind
# expansion bought invisibility for free.
#
# ``CORE_BEACON_BYTE`` is the public, fixed constant a core's own cells hold
# instead. It is Ruleset knowledge on exactly the same footing as
# ``CORE_SIZE`` already is (``core_defender``/``reactive_core_defender``/
# ``core_tracker`` all already hardcode ``8`` on that basis) -- not
# privileged information about any specific opponent, and deliberately not
# keyed to any reference agent: no agent needs to recognize this particular
# value to benefit, since every existing content-based searcher keys on
# "non-zero and not my own signature", which any non-zero beacon satisfies.
#
# ``0xCE`` was chosen, not computed: it must be non-zero (a zero beacon is
# the defect itself) and must differ from every signature byte used by any
# bundled starter or reference agent -- ``0x99`` (adaptive), ``0xC1``
# (claimer), ``0xE3`` (hunter), ``0xC2`` (strider), ``0x2C`` (wanderer),
# ``0xD3`` (core_defender), ``0x5E`` (core_seeker), ``0xA5`` (core_tracker),
# ``0xC7`` (reactive_core_defender) -- so that no agent is accidentally
# blinded to beacons by its own ``value != self.signature`` self-filter and
# no agent's ordinary territory is mistaken for a core.
CORE_BEACON_BYTE = 0xCE

# The historical alpha.1 seeding content: ownership without an observable
# footprint. Retained explicitly (rather than as a bare literal) so the

# v3 research Phase 2: experimental bounded locality
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The whole of the experimental mechanic, in one place, gated on one exact
# Ruleset identity. Under ``bytefray-rules-3-alpha1`` a Python entrant is no
# longer omnipresent: it occupies a single arena address (its *locus*) and
# may only read, write, or move within a bounded circular reach ``R`` of it.
#
# Three rules, and deliberately no fourth:
#
# 1. **Position.** One locus per entrant, engine-owned, initialized to the
#    entrant's own spawn address -- which is also its core anchor
#    (``core_start = entrant.start % arena_size``), so an entrant begins
#    standing on its own core and defending it is possible from action one.
#    Normalized ``% arena_size`` like every other address in this engine.
# 2. **Bounded reach.** ``LOCAL_READ``/``LOCAL_WRITE`` take a signed
#    *displacement* from the locus and are legal only while the circular
#    distance of that displacement is ``<= R``. ``MOVE`` takes a signed
#    displacement under the identical bound, so ``R`` is the single spatial
#    constant governing both sensing and locomotion; travel costs one action
#    per hop of at most ``R`` cells.
# 3. **Action accounting.** Every locality action -- including ``MOVE`` and
#    including an out-of-reach attempt -- consumes exactly one action slot
#    from the entrant's ordinary ``instr_per_tick`` budget. Locality creates
#    no additional throughput of any kind.
#
# An out-of-reach ``LOCAL_READ``/``LOCAL_WRITE``/``MOVE`` is a **no-op that
# still costs its action**, counted as a ``reach_miss``. It is deliberately
# neither a forfeit (which would make the experiment measure agent
# arithmetic bugs and mortality rather than strategy) nor silently clamped
# (which would invent semantics the agent never asked for). An agent is told
# ``R`` at reset via ``MatchContext.locality_reach`` and knows its own locus
# every action, so it can always avoid a reach miss; the counter exists so
# the report can say whether agents actually did.
#
# Explicitly NOT implemented, because the hypothesis is minimal: velocity,
# acceleration, facing/orientation, terrain, movement points, a separate
# movement cost dimension, multiple loci, and any fog-of-war mechanic
# distinct from locality itself.
LOCALITY_RULESET_IDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({BYTEFRAY_RULESET_V3_ALPHA1_ID})

# The reach used when a locality match does not name one. 64 is not
# computed: it is 8x CORE_SIZE (so a single position can cover a whole core
# window and its immediate surroundings without being able to cover two
# cores at any standard placement) and 1/64th of the default 4096 arena
# (so an entrant sees about 3% of the arena at a time and crossing the
# default half-arena separation costs 32 of its 3200 actions). Phase 2's
# pilot varies it; this is only the default a request may omit.

    Three properties this rule is carefully scoped to preserve, each of which

    * **Observability does not equal invulnerability.** Only cells the owner

      ``reactive_core_defender``'s ``0xC7`` core signatures survive intact

      ownership, and that is precisely what this repairs.
