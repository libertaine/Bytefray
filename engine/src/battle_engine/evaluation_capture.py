"""v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 1 capture/core-interaction analysis
(``docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE1_EVALUATION_METHODOLOGY.md`` Sec Capture).

Sibling of ``evaluation_analysis.py`` (outcome/win-rate evidence) and
``evaluation_behavior.py`` (behavior profile) -- not a replacement or
extension of either. This module answers a third, distinct question: "did
Ruleset v2's Vulnerable Core mechanism actually get exercised, and by
whom" -- capture, capture tick, and killer attribution, deliberately kept
separate from win/loss/score (Phase 1M: a captured entrant can still be
ahead on score at the moment of capture, per alpha.3's founding evidence;
win/loss alone would erase this). Nothing here reads or derives from win
rate or score, and nothing here feeds back into either sibling module.

One data tier, matching ``evaluation_behavior``'s own Tier 2: each scored
cell's already-written, sibling ``result.json`` (``battle2.result`` v1/v2,
read via ``result_model.read_result``). No replay reconstruction --
per-entrant ``termination_reason`` (Ruleset v2's ``"core_captured"``),
``statistics.kills``, and the match's own ``ticks`` (which, for a match
that terminated via capture, *is* the capture tick -- Vulnerable Core
capture ends the match at the tick it is detected) are already sufficient.
Minimum core integrity over time is deliberately deferred (Phase 1L): it
would require per-tick replay reconstruction, a materially higher cost
class than every other v2 Phase 1 metric, and is not required for this
phase's methodology validation.

Meaningful for Ruleset v2 cells only -- a v1 cell's entrants never carry a
``"core_captured"`` termination reason (Ruleset v1 has no core-capture
mechanism), so ``captured`` is simply always ``False`` for v1 cells; this
module never special-cases Ruleset identity itself, it just reflects
whatever ``result.json`` actually recorded.
