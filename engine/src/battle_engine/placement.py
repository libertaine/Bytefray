"""Deterministic entrant start-address placement for direct native matches.

``bytefray run`` (and, transitively, Agent Designer's Simple/Advanced direct
matches, which invoke the same CLI without ever setting a start address --
see ``battle_engine.launchers.build_designer_match_arguments``) previously
defaulted every omitted ``--a-start``/``--b-start``/``--c-start`` to the
literal integer ``0``. That is a safe, compatible default under Ruleset v1
(no gameplay mechanic depends on the start address at all), but under the
permanent Ruleset v2 identity (``bytefray-rules-2``) every entrant's
``CORE_SIZE``-wide vulnerable core is anchored at its own start address
(``battle_engine.python_runtime.core_addresses``), so defaulting every
omitted start to the same address collapses every entrant's core onto the
same window -- the last entrant seeded owns it, and every earlier entrant is
core-captured before its first action (v2.0.0-rc1's release-blocking
defect).

This module is the one authoritative place that turns a caller's *partial*
knowledge of start addresses (some explicit, some omitted) into the
*complete* set of effective start addresses a match will actually run with.
It is deliberately narrow: GUI-independent, deterministic, and free of any
presentation or persistence concern. It does not validate the result for
overlap -- that is ``battle_engine.match_service.NativeMatchService``'s job
(the one guard every caller, including direct ``MatchRequest`` construction
that bypasses this module entirely, must pass through before any entrant
executes).

    a cross-platform, cross-version release requirement (a Windows/Linux or

    invalidate a replay). SHA-256 of an ASCII payload is fully specified by
    its standard: identical bytes in, identical bytes out, on every platform
    and every supported Python.

    The payload is domain-separated by a fixed ``"bytefray-rules-4-alpha2:
    placement:"`` namespace label so no other seed-derived quantity in the
    engine (``derive_agent_seed``, the VM's own seeding) can ever collide
    with it, and includes every input that changes the layout -- arena
    size, seat count, and the effective separation -- so two matches
    differing in any of them draw independent streams rather than sharing a
    prefix.

    v4.0.0-rc1 Phase 2: this namespace label is a fixed constant, not the
    *currently executing* Ruleset's own id -- it was never parameterized by
    a ``ruleset_id`` argument, and deliberately keeps its original alpha2
    spelling forever, unrenamed, now that the permanent stable identity
    (``bytefray-rules-4``) also selects ``core_placement="seeded"`` and
    reaches this exact function. Renaming it to track whichever Ruleset id
    triggered the call would silently change *every* seeded placement draw
    for identical ``(seed, arena_size, entrant_count)`` inputs the moment a
    caller's Ruleset id differed -- exactly the "resolved starting
    positions" identity the stable-v4 promotion must keep byte-identical to
    alpha2 (docs/research/v4/V4_RC1_PHASE2_STABLE_CONTRACT_PROMOTION.md
    Sec D). Its only job is domain separation from the engine's other
    seed-derived streams, and it already accomplishes that with a fixed
    string. See ``resolve_direct_match_starts``'s own docstring for the
    full "which Rulesets reach this function" list.

    ``% arena_size`` over a 64-bit draw carries a modulo bias below
    ``arena_size / 2**64``; for any arena this engine supports that is on the
    order of 2**-53, far beneath the point where it could influence an
    ecology measurement, and it is preferred to a rejection loop because it
    is branch-free and therefore trivially identical everywhere.

    The permanent Ruleset v2 identity (``bytefray-rules-2``): every omitted

    resolve to byte-identical addresses for identical ``(seed, arena_size,

    payload is a fixed constant, never the specific Ruleset id, precisely
