"""v2.0.0-beta2 Phase 3 multi-entrant ("group") strategic analysis
(``docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA2_PHASE3_MULTI_ENTRANT_ANALYSIS.md``).

Sibling of ``evaluation_analysis.py`` (Phase 4, outcome/win-rate),
``evaluation_behavior.py`` (Phase 5, behavior profile), and
``evaluation_capture.py`` (Beta2 Phase 1, capture/core evidence) -- not a
replacement or extension of any of them. Those three modules are, and
remain, exactly what they always were: a fixed, two-role (subject/
opponent) worldview appropriate for a pairwise cell. This module answers
the equivalent questions for a *group* (multi-entrant, N >= 3) cell,
where "subject vs. opponent" is not a meaningful frame -- every roster
entrant is a first-class subject of analysis, symmetrically, and
candidate designation is presentation metadata layered on top (see
``candidate_focused_view``), never baked into the underlying computation.
``analyze_group`` does not even take a candidate id as an argument -- the
per-entrant results it produces cannot depend on which entrant a caller
later chooses to present as "the candidate" (Sec 6/21 of the design doc).

One data tier, matching ``evaluation_behavior``/``evaluation_capture``'s own
Tier 2: each scored group cell's already-written, sibling ``result.json``
(``battle2.result`` v1, read via ``result_model.read_result``). No replay
reconstruction -- every metric here is derived from a cell's own persisted
``entrants``/``score``/``winner``/``ticks`` fields, read once per cell and
fanned out into one record per seat (not one ``result.json`` read per
entrant per cell -- N reads collapse to 1).

Outcome model (Sec 9 of the design doc): the engine's own winner semantics
(``battle_engine.results.resolve_winner``, survivor-only eligible, reused
unchanged) are authoritative. Three per-entrant states are derived from it,
never a flat win/loss: ``WINNER`` (this seat's agent_id is literally the
cell's resolved winner), ``SURVIVING_NON_WINNER`` (alive at match end but
not the winner -- includes every entrant in a tied/no-unique-winner cell,
which is exactly what "no entrant here is WINNER" already expresses without
a fourth enum value), and ``ELIMINATED`` (not alive at match end). A
surviving non-winner and an eliminated entrant are never collapsed into one
"loss" bucket the way ``agent_evaluation.EvaluationCell.outcome`` (kept
unchanged, for compatibility) does.

Captor/victim attribution (Sec 13/14): ``result.json`` records each
entrant's own aggregate ``kills``/``deaths`` counts, not a per-death event
log (the per-tick ``{"type": "kill", "victim": ..., "by": ...}`` events
python_runtime.apply_core_capture actually produces are published to the
*replay*, a materially higher cost tier -- deliberately not read here, see
"Deferred" below). For a cell with exactly one death total, attribution is
unambiguous by the same elimination logic ``evaluation_capture.py`` already
uses for the 2-entrant case (there is only one possible killer once there
is only one victim and only one entrant with a nonzero kill count) --
generalized here to N by checking "exactly one victim this cell" up front,
which happens to always be true at N=2 (so this function's N=2 behavior is
identical in spirit, though it lives in this module only for group cells
and never replaces ``evaluation_capture.load_cell_capture_sample``). For a
cell with two or more deaths, aggregate kill counts alone cannot say which
death which entrant is responsible for -- attribution is left ``None``
(unattributable), the same honest "never guessed" contract every capture
sample in this codebase already follows, disclosed via
``InteractionMatrix.unattributed_captures`` rather than hidden.

Capture *timing* (Sec 14 "mean/median capture tick"): a cell's own
``ticks`` is the match's own final tick count, not necessarily the tick any
particular capture happened on -- those coincide only when the capture
event is itself what ended the match (``termination_reason`` is
alive-count-driven: ``last_agent_standing``/``all_agents_dead``). At N >= 3
a capture frequently does *not* end the match (two or more entrants can
remain alive afterward), so the match keeps running to the tick budget
under ``tick_limit`` -- reporting ``ticks`` as that capture's tick would
overstate it, often by hundreds of ticks (found via this phase's own
characterization runs, not merely hypothesized).

Beta2 Phase 4.1 (H3): an alive-count-driven ``termination_reason`` alone
only proves the match's *last* death happened at ``ticks`` -- at N >= 3,
two or more entrants can die over the course of a match (e.g. B at tick 50,
C at tick 900, match ends at 900), and this Tier-2 read (aggregate
``result.json`` fields only, never a per-tick replay log) has no way to
tell which death was the terminal one once more than one occurred. The
trust rule is therefore narrower than "the match ended by alive-count":
victim-side ``capture_tick`` is populated only when ``total_deaths == 1``
for the whole cell -- i.e. only when this capture is provably the one and
only death, and therefore provably the terminal event -- in addition to
``termination_reason`` confirming an alive-count end. Directed
``capture_tick_caused`` was already this conservative for an independent
reason (``_resolve_group_captors`` itself only ever attributes a captor
when ``total_deaths == 1``, see its own docstring), so this is not a new
restriction there, only made explicit. The fact of the capture itself
(``captured``, ``captor_of``, every rate in ``EntrantSummary``) is
unaffected by any of this and always reported when known -- only the
numeric tick is withheld when it cannot be trusted.

Deferred (see the design doc's "analysis compatibility" / "remaining
limitations" sections): full per-tick directed kill/capture event logs
(would require replay reconstruction, a Tier-3 cost class); minimum core
integrity over time (Phase 1L's deferral, unchanged, same reason); any
combined cross-dimension "strategic score" (mirrors
``evaluation_behavior``'s Sec 11 refusal to manufacture weights across
incommensurate units -- this module reports transparent per-dimension
ranges, never an opaque composite).
