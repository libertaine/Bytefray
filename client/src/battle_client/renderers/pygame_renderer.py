"""Interactive Pygame replay viewer, driven entirely by ``ReplaySession``.

``PygameRenderer`` is no longer an ``AbstractRenderer`` subclass and is not
driven by ``ReplayPlayer``'s one-shot forward stream: it is interactive
(play/pause/step/seek/restart/speed), and a forward-only record iterator
cannot represent "go back". Instead, ``PygameRenderer.run(session, ...)``
owns a normal Pygame event/render loop and reads reconstructed state
directly from a ``battle_client.session.ReplaySession`` on every frame via
``session.current_state`` -- there is no second, renderer-owned
reconstruction of arena bytes, ownership, agent state, or score anywhere
in this module. The only per-frame state this renderer keeps for itself is
purely visual and transient (recent write flashes, agent trails, and --
Phase 7b Slice 3 -- a tick-indexed "recent activity" recency map); all of
it is cleared on any non-linear tick change (a seek/restart, as opposed to
a plain forward step), so it never implies history that didn't actually
happen at the tick currently on screen. The one exception is the
territory-history trend graph, which is precomputed once per loaded
session (see ``compute_territory_history``) rather than accumulated
per-frame, since it reads as "this match's territory history up to now"
regardless of how the viewer got to the current tick.

``HeadlessRenderer`` (a different renderer, in ``renderers/headless.py``)
is unaffected by any of this and still uses the original
``ReplayPlayer``/``AbstractRenderer`` streaming path.

**Beta1 Phase 4 (HUD separation).** The window is tiled into three
non-overlapping bands -- a top HUD band (match header + one status card
per entrant), a middle arena band, and a bottom footer band (playback/tick,
a compact status/event message, controls, and the territory-history graph)
-- via ``battle_client.hud_layout.calculate_layout``. Only spatially
meaningful overlays (ownership tint, recent-activity heatmap, write
flashes, agent trails/markers, the selected-cell highlight) are drawn on
the arena band itself; everything else lives in a band. Per-entrant status
(alive/dead, Ruleset-v2 core integrity/capture/attribution, score,
territory, kills) is read entirely from ``battle_client.replay_status.
get_entrant_statuses`` (the Phase-3 status model) -- this module never
derives core addresses, ownership, capture state, death state, killer, or
Ruleset semantics from raw replay structures itself. See
``docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PHASE4_REPLAY_HUD.md`` for the full design record.

        The three hit targets are disjoint bands by construction (see
        ``hud_layout.calculate_layout``), so their order is about intent
        rather than overlap resolution: the timeline is checked first
        because grabbing it also begins a drag (see ``_timeline_scrubbing``),
        which must not be started by a click that merely landed near it.

        The footer's event message takes priority over the arena when both
        could apply: a click resolving to its (single) event tick seeks and
        returns immediately, without also touching cell selection.
        Arbitrary recorded-tick seeking goes through ``PlaybackController``
        so presentation code receives an explicit navigation report; replay
        reconstruction itself still remains entirely in ``ReplaySession``.

        the arena band's own local coordinates -- see ``_arena_rect``), it
        becomes the selected address (see ``_selected_address``) -- a
        presentation-only selection, not a navigation command, so it never
        pauses playback. A click that hits neither the footer's event
        message nor a valid arena cell (outside the arena band, or before
        the renderer has a real screen -- e.g. in a unit test that never

        cleared, not rebuilt from nearby replay history. Rebuilding would

        The title line always names the ribbon's information domain
        (``BROADCAST`` or ``<entrant> KNOWS``), so a viewer never has to
        infer whether they are reading canonical facts or the selected
        entrant's own knowledge -- the Phase 8 brief's Sec. 18 "no ambiguous
        middle state" requirement, answered on screen rather than only in
        documentation.

        Entry text is drawn in the ribbon's own single accent color, never in
        the subject entrant's palette color. Coloring an entry by entrant
        would create exactly the identity association Sec. 27/37 forbid: an
        anonymous contact and a colored ribbon entry appearing together would
        let a viewer join the two.
