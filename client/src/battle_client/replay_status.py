"""Ruleset-aware, replay-derived entrant status model (Beta1 Phase 3).

This module answers one question for the eventual Replay Viewer HUD (Beta1
Phase 4): *what is the status of every entrant at the replay's current
position?* -- alive/dead, core integrity/capture, capture attribution, and
the existing score/territory/kill facts the replay already carries. It is a
renderer-neutral domain layer, exactly like ``battle_client.analysis``: no
Pygame import, directly or indirectly, and it derives everything from
``battle_client.session`` (``ReplaySession``/``ReplayState``) plus a small,
explicitly justified set of shared domain helpers imported from
``battle_engine.python_runtime`` (never the reverse -- ``battle_engine``
never imports ``battle_client``).

See ``docs/archive/v2/V2_0_BETA1_PHASE3_REPLAY_SEMANTICS.md`` for the full audit this
model is built on. Three points from that audit matter most while reading
this module:

1. **No replay schema change was needed.** Every fact below -- including
   each entrant's own fixed core-anchor address -- is already present in a
   canonical ``battle2.replay`` v3 artifact; nothing new is persisted.
2. **Core integrity is ownership, never byte content.** Every derivation
   here counts ``ReplayState.owners`` entries; it never inspects
   ``ReplayState.arena`` byte values. This is what makes a beacon-restored
   cell "intact" and a non-zero-but-foreign-owned cell "damaged" --
   matching ``bytefray-rules-2``'s runtime semantics exactly (see
   ``docs/RULES_V2.md``'s "How is a core damaged" section).
3. **Status reflects a completed tick.** ``ReplayState`` (whatever tick it
   was reconstructed at) already represents state *after* that tick's
   capture check and maintenance ran -- there is no separate "mid-tick"
   status to compute.
