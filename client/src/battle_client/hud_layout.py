"""Deterministic HUD layout/formatting for the Pygame Replay Viewer
(Beta1 Phase 4).

This module is the "geometry calculation" and "text construction" halves of
the three-way split the governing task calls for (geometry / text / drawing
kept separate). Nothing here imports ``pygame`` -- every function is a pure,
directly-testable computation over primitive values and the Phase-3
``battle_client.replay_status.EntrantReplayStatus`` model. ``pygame_renderer.
PygameRenderer`` is the only "drawing" consumer of this module.

Two governing rules, both enforced by construction here:

* **The arena shows the battle. The HUD explains the battle.** Every rect
  this module hands back tiles the window into non-overlapping bands: a top
  HUD band (match header + one card per entrant), a middle arena band, and
  a bottom footer band (the whole-match timeline, playback/tick, one
  compact status line, controls, and the territory-history graph). The
  arena band is never covered by any of the others.
* **The Replay Viewer renders the Phase-3 status model; it does not decide
  what a core, capture, death, or winner means.** Every formatting function
  below only ever reads already-derived fields off ``EntrantReplayStatus``/
  ``CoreStatus`` (or plain already-resolved strings/numbers the caller
  supplies) -- never raw replay structures, never a Ruleset identity
  membership check.
